Since different testing companies use different ethnic reference groups and different matching algorithms, ethnicity estimates for an individual vary between tests, sometimes dramatically.\\nThree principal types of genealogical DNA tests are available, with each looking at a different part of the genome and being useful for different types of genealogical research: autosomal (atDNA), mitochondrial (mtDNA), and Y-DNA.\\nAutosomal tests may result in a large number of DNA matches to both males and females who have also tested with the same company. Each match will typically show an estimated degree of relatedness, i.e., a close family match, 1st-2nd cousins, 3rd-4th cousins, etc. The furthest degree of relationship is usually the \"6th-cousin or further\" level. However, due to the random nature of which, and how much, DNA is inherited by each tested person from their common ancestors, precise relationship conclusions can only be made for close relations. Traditional genealogical research, and the sharing of family trees, is typically required for interpretation of the results. Autosomal tests are also used in estimating ethnic mix.\\nMtDNA and Y-DNA tests are much more objective. However, they give considerably fewer DNA matches, if any (depending on the company doing the testing), since they are limited to relationships along a strict female line and a strict male line respectively.  MtDNA and Y-DNA tests are utilized to identify archeological cultures and migration paths of a person\\'s ancestors along a strict mother\\'s line or a strict father\\'s line. Based on MtDNA and Y-DNA, a person\\'s haplogroup(s) can be identified. The mtDNA test can be taken by both males and females, because everyone inherits their mtDNA from their mother, as the mitochondrial DNA is located in the egg cell. However, a Y-DNA test can only be taken by a male, as only males have a Y-chromosome.\\n\\n\\n== DNA testing for consumers ==\\nThe first company to provide direct-to-consumer genetic DNA testing was the now defunct GeneTree. However, it did not offer multi-generational genealogy tests. In fall 2001, GeneTree sold its assets to Salt Lake City-based Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation (SMGF) which originated in 1999.\\nWhile in operation, SMGF provided free Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA tests to thousands.\\nLater, GeneTree returned to genetic testing for genealogy in conjunction with the Sorenson parent company and eventually was part of the assets acquired in the Ancestry.com buyout of SMGF in 2012.In 2000, Family Tree DNA, founded by Bennett Greenspan and Max Blankfeld, was the first company dedicated to direct-to-consumer testing for genealogy research. They initially offered eleven-marker Y-Chromosome STR tests and HVR1 mitochondrial DNA tests. They originally tested in partnership with the University of Arizona.In 2007, 23andMe was the first company to offer a saliva-based direct-to-consumer genetic testing. It was also the first to implement the use of autosomal DNA for ancestry testing, which other major companies (e.g., Ancestry, Family Tree DNA, and MyHeritage) now use.MyHeritage launched its genetic testing service in 2016, allowing users to use cheek swabs to collect samples. In 2019, new analysis tools were presented: autoclusters (grouping all matches visually into clusters) and family tree theories (suggesting conceivable relations between DNA matches by combining several Myheritage trees as well as the Geni global family tree).Living DNA, founded in 2015, also provides a genetic testing service. Living DNA uses SNP chips to provide reports on autosomal ancestry, Y, and mtDNA ancestry. Living DNA provides detailed reports on ancestry from the UK as well as detailed Y chromosome and mtDNA reports.In 2019 it was estimated that large genealogical testing companies had about 26 million DNA profiles. Many transferred their test result for free to multiple testing sites, and also to genealogical services such as Geni.com and GEDmatch. GEDmatch said in 2018 that about half of their one million profiles were from the USA.The popular consciousness of DNA testing and of DNA generally is subject to a number of misconceptions involving the reliability of testing, the nature of the connections with one\\'s ancestors, the connection between DNA and personal traits, etc.\\n\\n\\n== Procedure ==\\n\\nA genealogical DNA test is performed on a DNA sample obtained by cheek-scraping (also known as a buccal swab), spit-cups, mouthwash, or chewing gum.  Typically, the sample collection uses a home test kit supplied by a service provider such as 23andMe, AncestryDNA, Family Tree DNA, or MyHeritage. After following the kit instructions on how to collect the sample, it is returned to the supplier for analysis. The sample is then processed using a technology known as DNA microarray to obtain the genetic information.\\n\\n\\n== Types of tests ==\\nThere are three major types of genealogical DNA tests: Autosomal (which includes X-DNA), Y-DNA, and mtDNA.\\n\\nAutosomal DNA tests look at chromosome pairs 1–22 and the X part of the 23rd chromosome. The autosomes (chromosome pairs 1–22) are inherited from both parents and all recent ancestors. The X-chromosome follows a special inheritance pattern, because females (XX) inherit an X-chromosome from each of their parents, while males (XY) inherit an X-chromosome from their mother and a Y-chromosome from their father (XY). Ethnicity estimates are often included with this sort of testing.\\nY-DNA looks at the Y-chromosome, which is passed down from father to son. Thus, the Y-DNA test can only be taken by males to explore their direct paternal line.\\nmtDNA looks at the mitochondria, which is passed down from mother to child. Thus, the mtDNA test can be taken by both males and females, and it explores one\\'s direct maternal line.Y-DNA and mtDNA cannot be used for ethnicity estimates, but can be used to find one\\'s haplogroup, which is unevenly distributed geographically. Direct-to-consumer DNA test companies have often labeled haplogroups by continent or ethnicity (e.g., an \"African haplogroup\" or a \"Viking haplogroup\"), but these labels may be speculative or misleading.\\n\\n\\n=== Autosomal DNA (atDNA) testing ===\\n\\n\\n==== Testing ====\\nAutosomal DNA is contained in the 22 pairs of chromosomes not involved in determining a person\\'s sex. Autosomal DNA recombines in each generation, and new offspring receive one set of chromosomes from each parent. These are inherited exactly equally from both parents and roughly equally from grandparents to about 3x great-grandparents. Therefore, the number of markers (one of two or more known variants in the genome at a particular location – known as Single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) inherited from a specific ancestor decreases by about half with each successive generation; that is, an individual receives half of their markers from each parent, about a quarter of those markers from each grandparent; about an eighth of those markers from each great-grandparent, etc. Inheritance is more random and unequal from more distant ancestors. Generally, a genealogical DNA test might test about 700,000 SNPs (specific points in the genome).\\n\\n\\n==== Reporting process ====\\nThe preparation of a report on the DNA in the sample proceeds in multiple stages:\\n\\nidentification of the DNA base pair at specific SNP locations\\ncomparison with previously stored results\\ninterpretation of matches\\n\\n\\n===== Base pair identification =====\\nAll major service providers use equipment with chips supplied by Illumina. The chip determines which SNP locations are tested. Different versions of the chip are used by different service providers. In addition, updated versions of the Illumina chip may test different sets of SNP locations. The list of SNP locations and base pairs at that location is usually available to the customer as \"raw data\". The raw data can sometimes be uploaded to another service provider to produce an additional interpretation and matches. For additional analysis the data can also be uploaded to GEDmatch (a third-party web based set of tools that analyzes raw data from the main service providers).\\n\\n\\n==== Identification of Matches ====\\nThe major component of an autosomal DNA test is matching other individuals. Where the individual being tested has a number of consecutive SNPs in common with a previously tested individual in the company\\'s database, it can be inferred that they share a segment of DNA at that part of their genomes. If the segment is longer than a threshold amount set by the testing company, then these two individuals are considered to be a match. Unlike the identification of base pairs, the data bases against which the new sample is tested, and the algorithms used to determine a match, are proprietary and specific to each company.\\nThe unit for segments of DNA is the centimorgan (cM). For comparison, a full human genome is about 6500 cM. The shorter the length of a match, the greater are the chances that a match is spurious. An important statistic for subsequent interpretation is the length of the shared DNA (or the percentage of the genome that is shared).\\n\\n\\n==== Interpretation of Autosomal matches ====\\nMost companies will show the customers how many cMs they share and across how many segments. From the number of cMs and segments, the relationship between the two individuals can be estimated; however, due to the random nature of DNA inheritance, relationship estimates, especially for distant relatives, are only approximate. Some more distant cousins will not match at all. Although information about specific SNPs can be used for some purposes (e.g., suggesting likely eye color), the key information is the percentage of DNA shared by two individuals. This can indicate the closeness of the relationship. However, it does not show the roles of the two individuals, e.g., 50% shared suggests a parent/child relationship, but it does not identify which individual is the parent.\\nVarious advanced techniques and analyses can be done on this data. This includes features such as In-common/Shared Matches, Chromosome Browsers, and Triangulation. This analysis is often required if DNA evidence is being used to prove or disprove a specific relationship.\\n\\n\\n=== X-chromosome DNA testing ===\\nThe X-chromosome SNP results are often included in autosomal DNA tests.  Both males and females receive an X-chromosome from their mother, but only females receive a second X-chromosome from their father. The X-chromosome has a special path of inheritance patterns and can be useful in significantly narrowing down possible ancestor lines compared to autosomal DNA. For example, an X-chromosome match with a male can only have come from his maternal side. Like autosomal DNA, X-chromosome DNA undergoes random recombination at each generation (except for father-to-daughter X-chromosomes, which are passed down unchanged). There are specialized inheritance charts which describe the possible patterns of X-chromosome DNA inheritance for males and females.\\n\\n\\n=== STRs ===\\nSome genealogical companies offer autosomal STRs (short tandem repeats). These are similar to Y-DNA STRs. The number of STRs offered is limited, and results have been used for personal identification, paternity cases, and inter-population studies.Law enforcement agencies in the US and Europe use autosomal STR data to identify criminals.\\n\\n\\n=== Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing ===\\nThe mitochondrion is a component of a human cell, and contains its own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA usually has 16,569 base pairs (the number can vary slightly depending on addition or deletion mutations) and is much smaller than the human genome DNA which has 3.2 billion base pairs.  Mitochondrial DNA is transmitted from mother to child, as it is contained in the egg cell. Thus, a direct maternal ancestor can be traced using mtDNA. The transmission occurs with relatively rare mutations compared to autosomal DNA. A perfect match found to another person\\'s mtDNA test results indicates shared ancestry of possibly between 1 and 50 generations ago. More distant matching to a specific haplogroup or subclade may be linked to a common geographic origin.\\n\\n\\n==== Test ====\\nThe mtDNA, by current conventions, is divided into three regions. They are the coding region (00577-16023) and two Hyper Variable Regions (HVR1 [16024-16569], and HVR2 [00001-00576]).The two most common mtDNA tests are a sequence of HVR1 and HVR2 and a full sequence of the mitochondria. Generally, testing only the HVRs has limited genealogical use so it is increasingly popular and accessible to have a full sequence. The full mtDNA sequence is only offered by Family Tree DNA among the major testing companies and is somewhat controversial because the coding region DNA may reveal medical information about the test-taker\\n\\n\\n==== Haplogroups ====\\n\\nAll humans descend in the direct female line from Mitochondrial Eve, a female who lived probably around 150,000 years ago in Africa. Different branches of her descendants are different haplogroups. Most mtDNA results include a prediction or exact assertion of one\\'s mtDNA Haplogroup. Mitochrondial haplogroups were greatly popularized by the book The Seven Daughters of Eve, which explores mitochondrial DNA.\\n\\n\\n==== Understanding mtDNA test results ====\\nIt is not normal for test results to give a base-by-base list of results. Instead, results are normally compared to the Cambridge Reference Sequence (CRS), which is the mitochondria of a European who was the first person to have their mtDNA published in 1981 (and revised in 1999). Differences between the CRS and testers are usually very few, thus it is more convenient than listing one\\'s raw results for each base pair.\\n\\nExamples\\nNote that in HVR1, instead of reporting the base pair exactly, for example 16,111, the 16 is often removed to give in this example 111. The letters refer to one of the four bases (A, T, G, C) that make up DNA.\\n\\n\\n=== Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) testing ===\\nThe Y-chromosome is one of the 23rd pair of human chromosomes. Only males have a Y-chromosome, because women have two X chromosomes in their 23rd pair. A man\\'s patrilineal ancestry, or male-line ancestry, can be traced using the DNA on his Y-chromosome (Y-DNA), because the Y-chromosome is transmitted from a father to son nearly unchanged. A man\\'s test results are compared to another man\\'s results to determine the time frame in which the two individuals shared a most recent common ancestor, or MRCA, in their direct patrilineal lines. If their test results are very close, they are related within a genealogically useful time frame. A surname project is where many individuals whose Y-chromosomes match collaborate to find their common ancestry.\\nWomen who wish to determine their direct paternal DNA ancestry can ask their father, brother, paternal uncle, paternal grandfather, or a paternal uncle\\'s son (their cousin) to take a test for them.\\nThere are two types of DNA testing: STRs and SNPs.\\n\\n\\n==== STR markers ====\\nMost common is STRs (short tandem repeat). A certain section of DNA is examined for a pattern that repeats (e.g. ATCG). The number of times it repeats is the value of the marker. Typical tests test between 12 and 111 STR markers. STRs mutate fairly frequently. The results of two individuals are then compared to see if there is a match. DNA companies will usually provide an estimate of how closely related two people are, in terms of generations or years, based on the difference between their results.\\n\\n\\n==== SNP markers and Haplogroups ====\\nA person\\'s haplogroup can often be inferred from their STR results, but can be proven only with a Y-chromosome SNP test (Y-SNP test).\\nA single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a change to a single nucleotide in a DNA sequence. Typical Y-DNA SNP tests test about 20,000 to 35,000 SNPs. Getting a SNP test allows a much higher resolution than STRs. It can be used to provide additional information about the relationship between two individuals and to confirm haplogroups.\\nAll human men descend in the paternal line from a single man dubbed Y-chromosomal Adam, who lived probably between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago. A \\'family tree\\' can be drawn showing how men today descend from him. Different branches of this tree are different haplogroups. Most haplogroups can be further subdivided multiple times into sub-clades. Some known sub-clades were founded in the last 1000 years, meaning their timeframe approaches the genealogical era (c.1500 onwards).New sub-clades of haplogroups may be discovered when an individual tests, especially if they are non-European. Most significant of these new discoveries was in 2013 when the haplogroup A00 was discovered, which required theories about Y-chromosomal Adam to be significantly revised. The haplogroup was discovered when an African-American man tested STRs at FamilyTreeDNA and his results were found to be unusual. SNP testing confirmed that he does not descend patrilineally from the \"old\" Y-chromosomal Adam and so a much older man became Y-Chromosomal Adam.\\n\\n\\n=== Using DNA test results ===\\n\\n\\n==== Ethnicity estimates ====\\nMany companies offer a percentage breakdown by ethnicity or region. Generally the world is specified into about 20–25 regions, and the approximate percentage of DNA inherited from each is stated. This is usually done by comparing the frequency of each Autosomal DNA marker tested to many population groups. The reliability of this type of test is dependent on comparative population size, the number of markers tested, the ancestry informative value of the SNPs tested, and the degree of admixture in the person tested. Earlier ethnicity estimates were often wildly inaccurate, but as companies receive more samples over time, ethnicity estimates have become more accurate. Testing companies such as Ancestry.com will often regularly update their ethnicity estimates, which has caused some controversy from customers as their results update. Usually the results at the continental level are accurate, but more specific assertions of the test may turn out to be incorrect.\\n\\n\\n== Audience ==\\nThe interest in genealogical DNA tests has been linked to both an increase in curiosity about traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins. Those who test for traditional genealogy often utilize a combination of autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y-Chromosome tests. Those with an interest in personal ethnic origins are more likely to use an autosomal test. However, answering specific questions about the ethnic origins of a particular lineage may be best suited to an mtDNA test or a Y-DNA test.\\n\\n\\n=== Maternal origin tests ===\\nFor recent genealogy, exact matching on the mtDNA full sequence is used to confirm a common ancestor on the direct maternal line between two suspected relatives. Because mtDNA mutations are very rare, a nearly perfect match is not usually considered relevant to the most recent 1 to 16 generations. In cultures lacking matrilineal surnames to pass down, neither relative above is likely to have as many generations of ancestors in their matrilineal information table as in the above patrilineal or Y-DNA case: for further information on this difficulty in traditional genealogy, due to lack of matrilineal surnames (or matrinames), see Matriname. However, the foundation of testing is still two suspected descendants of one person. This hypothesize and test DNA pattern is the same one used for autosomal DNA and Y-DNA.\\n\\n\\n=== Tests for ethnicity and membership of other groups ===\\n\\nAs discussed above, autosomal tests usually report the ethnic proportions of the individual. These attempt to measure an individual\\'s mixed geographic heritage by identifying particular markers, called ancestry informative markers or AIM, that are associated with populations of specific geographical areas. Geneticist Adam Rutherford has written that these tests \"don’t necessarily show your geographical origins in the past. They show with whom you have common ancestry today.\"The haplogroups determined by Y-DNA and mtDNA tests are often unevenly geographically distributed. Many direct-to-consumer DNA tests described this association to infer the test-taker\\'s ancestral homeland. Most tests describe haplogroups according to their most frequently associated continent (e.g., a \"European haplogroup\"). When Leslie Emery and collaborators performed a trial of mtDNA haplogroups as a predictor of continental origin on individuals in the Human Genetic Diversity Panel (HGDP) and 1000 Genomes (1KGP) datasets, they found that only 14 of 23 haplogroups had a success rate above 50% among the HGDP samples, as did \"about half\" of the haplogroups in the 1KGP. The authors concluded that, for most people, \"mtDNA-haplogroup membership provides limited information about either continental ancestry or continental region of origin.\"\\n\\n\\n==== African ancestry ====\\nY-DNA and mtDNA testing may be able to determine with which peoples in present-day Africa a person shares a direct line of part of his or her ancestry, but patterns of historic migration and historical events cloud the tracing of ancestral groups. Due to joint long histories in the US, approximately 30% of African American males have a European Y-Chromosome haplogroup Approximately 58% of African Americans have at least the equivalent of one great-grandparent (13%) of European ancestry. Only about 5% have the equivalent of one great-grandparent of Native American ancestry. By the early 19th century, substantial families of Free Persons of Color had been established in the Chesapeake Bay area who were descended from free people during the colonial period; most of those have been documented as descended from white men and African women (servant, slave or free). Over time various groups married more within mixed-race, black or white communities.According to authorities like Salas, nearly three-quarters of the ancestors of African Americans taken in slavery came from regions of West Africa. The African-American movement to discover and identify with ancestral tribes has burgeoned since DNA testing became available. African Americans usually cannot easily trace their ancestry during the years of slavery through surname research, census and property records, and other traditional means. Genealogical DNA testing may provide a tie to regional African heritage.\\n\\n\\n==== United States – Melungeon testing ====\\n\\nMelungeons are one of numerous multiracial groups in the United States with origins wrapped in myth. The historical research of Paul Heinegg has documented that many of the Melungeon groups in the Upper South were descended from mixed-race people who were free in colonial Virginia and the result of unions between the Europeans and Africans. They moved to the frontiers of Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee to gain some freedom from the racial barriers of the plantation areas. Several efforts, including a number of ongoing studies, have examined the genetic makeup of families historically identified as Melungeon. Most results point primarily to a mixture of European and African, which is supported by historical documentation. Some may have Native American heritage as well. Though some companies provide additional Melungeon research materials with Y-DNA and mtDNA tests, any test will allow comparisons with the results of current and past Melungeon DNA studies\\n\\n\\n==== Native American ancestry ====\\n\\nThe pre-columbian indigenous people of the United States are called \"Native Americans\" in American English. Autosomal testing, Y-DNA, and mtDNA testing can be conducted to determine the ancestry of Native Americans. A mitochondrial Haplogroup determination test based on mutations in Hypervariable Region 1 and 2 may establish whether a person\\'s direct female line belongs to one of the canonical Native American Haplogroups, A, B, C, D or X. The vast majority of Native American individuals belong to one of the five identified mtDNA Haplogroups. Thus, being in one of those groups provides evidence of potential Native American descent. However, DNA ethnicity results cannot be used as a substitute for legal documentation. Native American tribes have their own requirements for membership, often based on at least one of a person\\'s ancestors having been included on tribal-specific Native American censuses (or final rolls) prepared during treaty-making, relocation to reservations or apportionment of land in the late 19th century and early 20th century. One example is the Dawes Rolls.\\n\\n\\n==== Cohanim ancestry ====\\n\\nThe Cohanim (or Kohanim) is a patrilineal priestly line of descent in Judaism. According to the Bible, the ancestor of the Cohanim is Aaron, brother of Moses. Many believe that descent from Aaron is verifiable with a Y-DNA test: the first published study in genealogical Y-Chromosome DNA testing found that a significant percentage of Cohens had distinctively similar DNA, rather more so than general Jewish or Middle Eastern populations. These Cohens tended to belong to Haplogroup J, with Y-STR values clustered unusually closely around a haplotype known as the Cohen Modal Haplotype (CMH). This could be consistent with a shared common ancestor, or with the hereditary priesthood having originally been founded from members of a single closely related clan.\\nNevertheless, the original studies tested only six Y-STR markers, which is considered a low-resolution test. In response to the low resolution of the original 6-marker CMH, the testing company FTDNA released a 12-marker CMH signature that was more specific to the large closely related group of Cohens in Haplogroup J1.\\nA further academic study published in 2009 examined more STR markers and identified a more sharply defined SNP haplogroup, J1e* (now J1c3, also called J-P58*) for the J1 lineage. The research found \"that 46.1% of Kohanim carry Y chromosomes belonging to a single paternal lineage (J-P58*) that likely originated in the Near East well before the dispersal of Jewish groups in the Diaspora. Support for a Near Eastern origin of this lineage comes from its high frequency in our sample of Bedouins, Yemenis (67%), and Jordanians (55%) and its precipitous drop in frequency as one moves away from Saudi Arabia and the Near East (Fig. 4). Moreover, there is a striking contrast between the relatively high frequency of J-58* in Jewish populations (»20%) and Kohanim (»46%) and its vanishingly low frequency in our sample of non-Jewish populations that hosted Jewish diaspora communities outside of the Near East.\"Recent phylogenetic research for haplogroup J-M267 placed the \"Y-chromosomal Aaron\" in a subhaplogroup of J-L862, L147.1 (age estimate 5631-6778yBP yBP): YSC235>PF4847/CTS11741>YSC234>ZS241>ZS227>Z18271 (age estimate 2731yBP).\\n\\n\\n==== European testing ====\\n\\n\\n== Benefits ==\\n\\nGenealogical DNA tests have become popular due to the ease of testing at home and their usefulness in supplementing genealogical research. Genealogical DNA tests allow for an individual to determine with high accuracy whether he or she is related to another person within a certain time frame, or with certainty that he or she is not related. DNA tests are perceived as more scientific, conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records. However, they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied. The civil records are always only as accurate as the individuals having provided or written the information.\\nY-DNA testing results are normally stated as probabilities: For example, with the same surname a perfect 37/37 marker test match gives a 95% likelihood of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) being within 8 generations, while a 111 of 111 marker match gives the same 95% likelihood of the MRCA being within only 5 generations back.As presented above in mtDNA testing, if a perfect match is found, the mtDNA test results can be helpful. In some cases, research according to traditional genealogy methods encounters difficulties due to the lack of regularly recorded matrilineal surname information in many cultures (see Matrilineal surname).Autosomal DNA combined with genealogical research has been used by adoptees to find their biological parents, has been used to find the name and family of unidentified bodies and by law enforcement agencies to apprehend criminals (for example, the Contra Costa County District Attorney\\'s office used the \"open-source\" genetic genealogy site GEDmatch to find relatives of the suspect in the Golden State Killer case.). The Atlantic magazine commented in 2018 that \"Now, the floodgates are open. ..a small, volunteer-run website, GEDmatch.com, has become ... the de facto DNA and genealogy database for all of law enforcement.\" Family Tree DNA announced in February 2019 it was allowing the FBI to access its DNA data for cases of murder and rape. However, in May 2019 GEDmatch initiated stricter rules for accessing their autosomal DNA database and Family Tree DNA shut down their Y-DNA database ysearch.org, making it more difficult for law enforcement agencies to solve cases.\\n\\n\\n== Drawbacks ==\\nCommon concerns about genealogical DNA testing are cost and privacy issues. Some testing companies retain samples and results for their own use without a privacy agreement with subjects.Autosomal DNA tests can identify relationships but they can be misinterpreted. For example, transplants of stem cell or bone marrow will produce matches with the donor. In addition, identical twins (who have identical DNA) can give unexpected results.Testing of the Y-DNA lineage from father to son may reveal complications, due to unusual mutations, secret adoptions, and non-paternity events (i.e., that the perceived father in a generation is not the father indicated by written birth records). According to the Ancestry and Ancestry Testing Task Force of the American Society of Human Genetics, autosomal tests cannot detect \"large portions\" of DNA from distant ancestors because it has not been inherited.With the increasing popularity of the use of DNA tests for ethnicity tests, uncertainties and errors in ethnicity estimates are a drawback for Genetic genealogy. While ethnicity estimates at the continental level should be accurate (with the possible exception of East Asia and the Americas), sub-continental estimates, especially in Europe, are often inaccurate. Customers may be misinformed about the uncertainties and errors of the estimates.Some have recommended government or other regulation of ancestry testing to ensure its performance to an agreed standard.A number of law enforcement agencies took legal action to compel\\ngenetic genealogy companies to release genetic information that could match cold case crime victims or perpetrators. A number of companies fought the requests.\\n\\n\\n== Medical information ==\\nThough genealogical DNA tests are not designed mainly for medical purposes, autosomal DNA tests can be used to analyze the probability of hundreds of heritable medical conditions, albeit the result is complex to understand and may confuse a non-expert.  23andMe provides medical and trait information from their genealogical DNA test and for a fee the Promethease web site analyses genealogical DNA test data from Family Tree DNA, 23andMe, or AncestryDNA for medical information. Promethease, and its research paper crawling database SNPedia, has received criticism for technical complexity and a poorly defined \"magnitude\" scale that causes misconceptions, confusion and panic among its users.The testing of full MtDNA and YDNA sequences is still somewhat controversial as it may reveal even more medical information. For example, a correlation exists between a lack of Y-DNA marker DYS464 and infertility, and between mtDNA haplogroup H and protection from sepsis. Certain haplogroups have been linked to longevity in some population groups. The field of linkage disequilibrium, unequal association of genetic disorders with a certain mitochondrial lineage, is in its infancy, but those mitochondrial mutations that have been linked are searchable in the genome database Mitomap. Family Tree DNA\\'s MtFull Sequence test analyses the full MtDNA genome and the National Human Genome Research Institute operates the Genetic And Rare Disease Information Center that can assist consumers in identifying an appropriate screening test and help locate a nearby medical center that offers such a test.\\n\\n\\n== DNA in genealogy software ==\\nSome genealogy software programs – such as Family Tree Maker, Legacy Family Tree (Deluxe Edition) and the Swedish program Genney – allow recording DNA marker test results. This allows for tracking of both Y-chromosome and mtDNA tests, and recording results for relatives.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nY-Haplogroups brief descriptions and regional origins'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":51}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["wiki_topic.images"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"EaVPcDi6KrEb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1652474699323,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":486,"user":{"displayName":"David E.

Since different testing companies use different ethnic reference groups and different matching algorithms, ethnicity estimates for an individual vary between tests, sometimes dramatically.\n","Three principal types of genealogical DNA tests are available, with each looking at a different part of the genome and being useful for different types of genealogical research: autosomal (atDNA), mitochondrial (mtDNA), and Y-DNA.\n","Autosomal tests may result in a large number of DNA matches to both males and females who have also tested with the same company. Each match will typically show an estimated degree of relatedness, i.e., a close family match, 1st-2nd cousins, 3rd-4th cousins, etc. The furthest degree of relationship is usually the \"6th-cousin or further\" level. However, due to the random nature of which, and how much, DNA is inherited by each tested person from their common ancestors, precise relationship conclusions can only be made for close relations. Traditional genealogical research, and the sharing of family trees, is typically required for interpretation of the results. Autosomal tests are also used in estimating ethnic mix.\n","MtDNA and Y-DNA tests are much more objective. However, they give considerably fewer DNA matches, if any (depending on the company doing the testing), since they are limited to relationships along a strict female line and a strict male line respectively.  MtDNA and Y-DNA tests are utilized to identify archeological cultures and migration paths of a person's ancestors along a strict mother's line or a strict father's line. Based on MtDNA and Y-DNA, a person's haplogroup(s) can be identified. The mtDNA test can be taken by both males and females, because everyone inherits their mtDNA from their mother, as the mitochondrial DNA is located in the egg cell. However, a Y-DNA test can only be taken by a male, as only males have a Y-chromosome.\n","\n","\n","== DNA testing for consumers ==\n","The first company to provide direct-to-consumer genetic DNA testing was the now defunct GeneTree. However, it did not offer multi-generational genealogy tests. In fall 2001, GeneTree sold its assets to Salt Lake City-based Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation (SMGF) which originated in 1999.\n","While in operation, SMGF provided free Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA tests to thousands.\n","Later, GeneTree returned to genetic testing for genealogy in conjunction with the Sorenson parent company and eventually was part of the assets acquired in the Ancestry.com buyout of SMGF in 2012.In 2000, Family Tree DNA, founded by Bennett Greenspan and Max Blankfeld, was the first company dedicated to direct-to-consumer testing for genealogy research. They initially offered eleven-marker Y-Chromosome STR tests and HVR1 mitochondrial DNA tests. They originally tested in partnership with the University of Arizona.In 2007, 23andMe was the first company to offer a saliva-based direct-to-consumer genetic testing. It was also the first to implement the use of autosomal DNA for ancestry testing, which other major companies (e.g., Ancestry, Family Tree DNA, and MyHeritage) now use.MyHeritage launched its genetic testing service in 2016, allowing users to use cheek swabs to collect samples. In 2019, new analysis tools were presented: autoclusters (grouping all matches visually into clusters) and family tree theories (suggesting conceivable relations between DNA matches by combining several Myheritage trees as well as the Geni global family tree).Living DNA, founded in 2015, also provides a genetic testing service. Living DNA uses SNP chips to provide reports on autosomal ancestry, Y, and mtDNA ancestry. Living DNA provides detailed reports on ancestry from the UK as well as detailed Y chromosome and mtDNA reports.In 2019 it was estimated that large genealogical testing companies had about 26 million DNA profiles. Many transferred their test result for free to multiple testing sites, and also to genealogical services such as Geni.com and GEDmatch. GEDmatch said in 2018 that about half of their one million profiles were from the USA.The popular consciousness of DNA testing and of DNA generally is subject to a number of misconceptions involving the reliability of testing, the nature of the connections with one's ancestors, the connection between DNA and personal traits, etc.\n","\n","\n","== Procedure ==\n","\n","A genealogical DNA test is performed on a DNA sample obtained by cheek-scraping (also known as a buccal swab), spit-cups, mouthwash, or chewing gum.  Typically, the sample collection uses a home test kit supplied by a service provider such as 23andMe, AncestryDNA, Family Tree DNA, or MyHeritage. After following the kit instructions on how to collect the sample, it is returned to the supplier for analysis. The sample is then processed using a technology known as DNA microarray to obtain the genetic information.\n","\n","\n","== Types of tests ==\n","There are three major types of genealogical DNA tests: Autosomal (which includes X-DNA), Y-DNA, and mtDNA.\n","\n","Autosomal DNA tests look at chromosome pairs 1–22 and the X part of the 23rd chromosome. The autosomes (chromosome pairs 1–22) are inherited from both parents and all recent ancestors. The X-chromosome follows a special inheritance pattern, because females (XX) inherit an X-chromosome from each of their parents, while males (XY) inherit an X-chromosome from their mother and a Y-chromosome from their father (XY). Ethnicity estimates are often included with this sort of testing.\n","Y-DNA looks at the Y-chromosome, which is passed down from father to son. Thus, the Y-DNA test can only be taken by males to explore their direct paternal line.\n","mtDNA looks at the mitochondria, which is passed down from mother to child. Thus, the mtDNA test can be taken by both males and females, and it explores one's direct maternal line.Y-DNA and mtDNA cannot be used for ethnicity estimates, but can be used to find one's haplogroup, which is unevenly distributed geographically. Direct-to-consumer DNA test companies have often labeled haplogroups by continent or ethnicity (e.g., an \"African haplogroup\" or a \"Viking haplogroup\"), but these labels may be speculative or misleading.\n","\n","\n","=== Autosomal DNA (atDNA) testing ===\n","\n","\n","==== Testing ====\n","Autosomal DNA is contained in the 22 pairs of chromosomes not involved in determining a person's sex. Autosomal DNA recombines in each generation, and new offspring receive one set of chromosomes from each parent. These are inherited exactly equally from both parents and roughly equally from grandparents to about 3x great-grandparents. Therefore, the number of markers (one of two or more known variants in the genome at a particular location – known as Single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) inherited from a specific ancestor decreases by about half with each successive generation; that is, an individual receives half of their markers from each parent, about a quarter of those markers from each grandparent; about an eighth of those markers from each great-grandparent, etc. Inheritance is more random and unequal from more distant ancestors. Generally, a genealogical DNA test might test about 700,000 SNPs (specific points in the genome).\n","\n","\n","==== Reporting process ====\n","The preparation of a report on the DNA in the sample proceeds in multiple stages:\n","\n","identification of the DNA base pair at specific SNP locations\n","comparison with previously stored results\n","interpretation of matches\n","\n","\n","===== Base pair identification =====\n","All major service providers use equipment with chips supplied by Illumina. The chip determines which SNP locations are tested. Different versions of the chip are used by different service providers. In addition, updated versions of the Illumina chip may test different sets of SNP locations. The list of SNP locations and base pairs at that location is usually available to the customer as \"raw data\". The raw data can sometimes be uploaded to another service provider to produce an additional interpretation and matches. For additional analysis the data can also be uploaded to GEDmatch (a third-party web based set of tools that analyzes raw data from the main service providers).\n","\n","\n","==== Identification of Matches ====\n","The major component of an autosomal DNA test is matching other individuals. Where the individual being tested has a number of consecutive SNPs in common with a previously tested individual in the company's database, it can be inferred that they share a segment of DNA at that part of their genomes. If the segment is longer than a threshold amount set by the testing company, then these two individuals are considered to be a match. Unlike the identification of base pairs, the data bases against which the new sample is tested, and the algorithms used to determine a match, are proprietary and specific to each company.\n","The unit for segments of DNA is the centimorgan (cM). For comparison, a full human genome is about 6500 cM. The shorter the length of a match, the greater are the chances that a match is spurious. An important statistic for subsequent interpretation is the length of the shared DNA (or the percentage of the genome that is shared).\n","\n","\n","==== Interpretation of Autosomal matches ====\n","Most companies will show the customers how many cMs they share and across how many segments. From the number of cMs and segments, the relationship between the two individuals can be estimated; however, due to the random nature of DNA inheritance, relationship estimates, especially for distant relatives, are only approximate. Some more distant cousins will not match at all. Although information about specific SNPs can be used for some purposes (e.g., suggesting likely eye color), the key information is the percentage of DNA shared by two individuals. This can indicate the closeness of the relationship. However, it does not show the roles of the two individuals, e.g., 50% shared suggests a parent/child relationship, but it does not identify which individual is the parent.\n","Various advanced techniques and analyses can be done on this data. This includes features such as In-common/Shared Matches, Chromosome Browsers, and Triangulation. This analysis is often required if DNA evidence is being used to prove or disprove a specific relationship.\n","\n","\n","=== X-chromosome DNA testing ===\n","The X-chromosome SNP results are often included in autosomal DNA tests.  Both males and females receive an X-chromosome from their mother, but only females receive a second X-chromosome from their father. The X-chromosome has a special path of inheritance patterns and can be useful in significantly narrowing down possible ancestor lines compared to autosomal DNA. For example, an X-chromosome match with a male can only have come from his maternal side. Like autosomal DNA, X-chromosome DNA undergoes random recombination at each generation (except for father-to-daughter X-chromosomes, which are passed down unchanged). There are specialized inheritance charts which describe the possible patterns of X-chromosome DNA inheritance for males and females.\n","\n","\n","=== STRs ===\n","Some genealogical companies offer autosomal STRs (short tandem repeats). These are similar to Y-DNA STRs. The number of STRs offered is limited, and results have been used for personal identification, paternity cases, and inter-population studies.Law enforcement agencies in the US and Europe use autosomal STR data to identify criminals.\n","\n","\n","=== Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing ===\n","The mitochondrion is a component of a human cell, and contains its own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA usually has 16,569 base pairs (the number can vary slightly depending on addition or deletion mutations) and is much smaller than the human genome DNA which has 3.2 billion base pairs.  Mitochondrial DNA is transmitted from mother to child, as it is contained in the egg cell. Thus, a direct maternal ancestor can be traced using mtDNA. The transmission occurs with relatively rare mutations compared to autosomal DNA. A perfect match found to another person's mtDNA test results indicates shared ancestry of possibly between 1 and 50 generations ago. More distant matching to a specific haplogroup or subclade may be linked to a common geographic origin.\n","\n","\n","==== Test ====\n","The mtDNA, by current conventions, is divided into three regions. They are the coding region (00577-16023) and two Hyper Variable Regions (HVR1 [16024-16569], and HVR2 [00001-00576]).The two most common mtDNA tests are a sequence of HVR1 and HVR2 and a full sequence of the mitochondria. Generally, testing only the HVRs has limited genealogical use so it is increasingly popular and accessible to have a full sequence. The full mtDNA sequence is only offered by Family Tree DNA among the major testing companies and is somewhat controversial because the coding region DNA may reveal medical information about the test-taker\n","\n","\n","==== Haplogroups ====\n","\n","All humans descend in the direct female line from Mitochondrial Eve, a female who lived probably around 150,000 years ago in Africa. Different branches of her descendants are different haplogroups. Most mtDNA results include a prediction or exact assertion of one's mtDNA Haplogroup. Mitochrondial haplogroups were greatly popularized by the book The Seven Daughters of Eve, which explores mitochondrial DNA.\n","\n","\n","==== Understanding mtDNA test results ====\n","It is not normal for test results to give a base-by-base list of results. Instead, results are normally compared to the Cambridge Reference Sequence (CRS), which is the mitochondria of a European who was the first person to have their mtDNA published in 1981 (and revised in 1999). Differences between the CRS and testers are usually very few, thus it is more convenient than listing one's raw results for each base pair.\n","\n","Examples\n","Note that in HVR1, instead of reporting the base pair exactly, for example 16,111, the 16 is often removed to give in this example 111. The letters refer to one of the four bases (A, T, G, C) that make up DNA.\n","\n","\n","=== Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) testing ===\n","The Y-chromosome is one of the 23rd pair of human chromosomes. Only males have a Y-chromosome, because women have two X chromosomes in their 23rd pair. A man's patrilineal ancestry, or male-line ancestry, can be traced using the DNA on his Y-chromosome (Y-DNA), because the Y-chromosome is transmitted from a father to son nearly unchanged. A man's test results are compared to another man's results to determine the time frame in which the two individuals shared a most recent common ancestor, or MRCA, in their direct patrilineal lines. If their test results are very close, they are related within a genealogically useful time frame. A surname project is where many individuals whose Y-chromosomes match collaborate to find their common ancestry.\n","Women who wish to determine their direct paternal DNA ancestry can ask their father, brother, paternal uncle, paternal grandfather, or a paternal uncle's son (their cousin) to take a test for them.\n","There are two types of DNA testing: STRs and SNPs.\n","\n","\n","==== STR markers ====\n","Most common is STRs (short tandem repeat). A certain section of DNA is examined for a pattern that repeats (e.g. ATCG). The number of times it repeats is the value of the marker. Typical tests test between 12 and 111 STR markers. STRs mutate fairly frequently. The results of two individuals are then compared to see if there is a match. DNA companies will usually provide an estimate of how closely related two people are, in terms of generations or years, based on the difference between their results.\n","\n","\n","==== SNP markers and Haplogroups ====\n","A person's haplogroup can often be inferred from their STR results, but can be proven only with a Y-chromosome SNP test (Y-SNP test).\n","A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a change to a single nucleotide in a DNA sequence. Typical Y-DNA SNP tests test about 20,000 to 35,000 SNPs. Getting a SNP test allows a much higher resolution than STRs. It can be used to provide additional information about the relationship between two individuals and to confirm haplogroups.\n","All human men descend in the paternal line from a single man dubbed Y-chromosomal Adam, who lived probably between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago. A 'family tree' can be drawn showing how men today descend from him. Different branches of this tree are different haplogroups. Most haplogroups can be further subdivided multiple times into sub-clades. Some known sub-clades were founded in the last 1000 years, meaning their timeframe approaches the genealogical era (c.1500 onwards).New sub-clades of haplogroups may be discovered when an individual tests, especially if they are non-European. Most significant of these new discoveries was in 2013 when the haplogroup A00 was discovered, which required theories about Y-chromosomal Adam to be significantly revised. The haplogroup was discovered when an African-American man tested STRs at FamilyTreeDNA and his results were found to be unusual. SNP testing confirmed that he does not descend patrilineally from the \"old\" Y-chromosomal Adam and so a much older man became Y-Chromosomal Adam.\n","\n","\n","=== Using DNA test results ===\n","\n","\n","==== Ethnicity estimates ====\n","Many companies offer a percentage breakdown by ethnicity or region. Generally the world is specified into about 20–25 regions, and the approximate percentage of DNA inherited from each is stated. This is usually done by comparing the frequency of each Autosomal DNA marker tested to many population groups. The reliability of this type of test is dependent on comparative population size, the number of markers tested, the ancestry informative value of the SNPs tested, and the degree of admixture in the person tested. Earlier ethnicity estimates were often wildly inaccurate, but as companies receive more samples over time, ethnicity estimates have become more accurate. Testing companies such as Ancestry.com will often regularly update their ethnicity estimates, which has caused some controversy from customers as their results update. Usually the results at the continental level are accurate, but more specific assertions of the test may turn out to be incorrect.\n","\n","\n","== Audience ==\n","The interest in genealogical DNA tests has been linked to both an increase in curiosity about traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins. Those who test for traditional genealogy often utilize a combination of autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y-Chromosome tests. Those with an interest in personal ethnic origins are more likely to use an autosomal test. However, answering specific questions about the ethnic origins of a particular lineage may be best suited to an mtDNA test or a Y-DNA test.\n","\n","\n","=== Maternal origin tests ===\n","For recent genealogy, exact matching on the mtDNA full sequence is used to confirm a common ancestor on the direct maternal line between two suspected relatives. Because mtDNA mutations are very rare, a nearly perfect match is not usually considered relevant to the most recent 1 to 16 generations. In cultures lacking matrilineal surnames to pass down, neither relative above is likely to have as many generations of ancestors in their matrilineal information table as in the above patrilineal or Y-DNA case: for further information on this difficulty in traditional genealogy, due to lack of matrilineal surnames (or matrinames), see Matriname. However, the foundation of testing is still two suspected descendants of one person. This hypothesize and test DNA pattern is the same one used for autosomal DNA and Y-DNA.\n","\n","\n","=== Tests for ethnicity and membership of other groups ===\n","\n","As discussed above, autosomal tests usually report the ethnic proportions of the individual. These attempt to measure an individual's mixed geographic heritage by identifying particular markers, called ancestry informative markers or AIM, that are associated with populations of specific geographical areas. Geneticist Adam Rutherford has written that these tests \"don’t necessarily show your geographical origins in the past. They show with whom you have common ancestry today.\"The haplogroups determined by Y-DNA and mtDNA tests are often unevenly geographically distributed. Many direct-to-consumer DNA tests described this association to infer the test-taker's ancestral homeland. Most tests describe haplogroups according to their most frequently associated continent (e.g., a \"European haplogroup\"). When Leslie Emery and collaborators performed a trial of mtDNA haplogroups as a predictor of continental origin on individuals in the Human Genetic Diversity Panel (HGDP) and 1000 Genomes (1KGP) datasets, they found that only 14 of 23 haplogroups had a success rate above 50% among the HGDP samples, as did \"about half\" of the haplogroups in the 1KGP. The authors concluded that, for most people, \"mtDNA-haplogroup membership provides limited information about either continental ancestry or continental region of origin.\"\n","\n","\n","==== African ancestry ====\n","Y-DNA and mtDNA testing may be able to determine with which peoples in present-day Africa a person shares a direct line of part of his or her ancestry, but patterns of historic migration and historical events cloud the tracing of ancestral groups. Due to joint long histories in the US, approximately 30% of African American males have a European Y-Chromosome haplogroup Approximately 58% of African Americans have at least the equivalent of one great-grandparent (13%) of European ancestry. Only about 5% have the equivalent of one great-grandparent of Native American ancestry. By the early 19th century, substantial families of Free Persons of Color had been established in the Chesapeake Bay area who were descended from free people during the colonial period; most of those have been documented as descended from white men and African women (servant, slave or free). Over time various groups married more within mixed-race, black or white communities.According to authorities like Salas, nearly three-quarters of the ancestors of African Americans taken in slavery came from regions of West Africa. The African-American movement to discover and identify with ancestral tribes has burgeoned since DNA testing became available. African Americans usually cannot easily trace their ancestry during the years of slavery through surname research, census and property records, and other traditional means. Genealogical DNA testing may provide a tie to regional African heritage.\n","\n","\n","==== United States – Melungeon testing ====\n","\n","Melungeons are one of numerous multiracial groups in the United States with origins wrapped in myth. The historical research of Paul Heinegg has documented that many of the Melungeon groups in the Upper South were descended from mixed-race people who were free in colonial Virginia and the result of unions between the Europeans and Africans. They moved to the frontiers of Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee to gain some freedom from the racial barriers of the plantation areas. Several efforts, including a number of ongoing studies, have examined the genetic makeup of families historically identified as Melungeon. Most results point primarily to a mixture of European and African, which is supported by historical documentation. Some may have Native American heritage as well. Though some companies provide additional Melungeon research materials with Y-DNA and mtDNA tests, any test will allow comparisons with the results of current and past Melungeon DNA studies\n","\n","\n","==== Native American ancestry ====\n","\n","The pre-columbian indigenous people of the United States are called \"Native Americans\" in American English. Autosomal testing, Y-DNA, and mtDNA testing can be conducted to determine the ancestry of Native Americans. A mitochondrial Haplogroup determination test based on mutations in Hypervariable Region 1 and 2 may establish whether a person's direct female line belongs to one of the canonical Native American Haplogroups, A, B, C, D or X. The vast majority of Native American individuals belong to one of the five identified mtDNA Haplogroups. Thus, being in one of those groups provides evidence of potential Native American descent. However, DNA ethnicity results cannot be used as a substitute for legal documentation. Native American tribes have their own requirements for membership, often based on at least one of a person's ancestors having been included on tribal-specific Native American censuses (or final rolls) prepared during treaty-making, relocation to reservations or apportionment of land in the late 19th century and early 20th century. One example is the Dawes Rolls.\n","\n","\n","==== Cohanim ancestry ====\n","\n","The Cohanim (or Kohanim) is a patrilineal priestly line of descent in Judaism. According to the Bible, the ancestor of the Cohanim is Aaron, brother of Moses. Many believe that descent from Aaron is verifiable with a Y-DNA test: the first published study in genealogical Y-Chromosome DNA testing found that a significant percentage of Cohens had distinctively similar DNA, rather more so than general Jewish or Middle Eastern populations. These Cohens tended to belong to Haplogroup J, with Y-STR values clustered unusually closely around a haplotype known as the Cohen Modal Haplotype (CMH). This could be consistent with a shared common ancestor, or with the hereditary priesthood having originally been founded from members of a single closely related clan.\n","Nevertheless, the original studies tested only six Y-STR markers, which is considered a low-resolution test. In response to the low resolution of the original 6-marker CMH, the testing company FTDNA released a 12-marker CMH signature that was more specific to the large closely related group of Cohens in Haplogroup J1.\n","A further academic study published in 2009 examined more STR markers and identified a more sharply defined SNP haplogroup, J1e* (now J1c3, also called J-P58*) for the J1 lineage. The research found \"that 46.1% of Kohanim carry Y chromosomes belonging to a single paternal lineage (J-P58*) that likely originated in the Near East well before the dispersal of Jewish groups in the Diaspora. Support for a Near Eastern origin of this lineage comes from its high frequency in our sample of Bedouins, Yemenis (67%), and Jordanians (55%) and its precipitous drop in frequency as one moves away from Saudi Arabia and the Near East (Fig. 4). Moreover, there is a striking contrast between the relatively high frequency of J-58* in Jewish populations (»20%) and Kohanim (»46%) and its vanishingly low frequency in our sample of non-Jewish populations that hosted Jewish diaspora communities outside of the Near East.\"Recent phylogenetic research for haplogroup J-M267 placed the \"Y-chromosomal Aaron\" in a subhaplogroup of J-L862, L147.1 (age estimate 5631-6778yBP yBP): YSC235&gt;PF4847/CTS11741&gt;YSC234&gt;ZS241&gt;ZS227&gt;Z18271 (age estimate 2731yBP).\n","\n","\n","==== European testing ====\n","\n","\n","== Benefits ==\n","\n","Genealogical DNA tests have become popular due to the ease of testing at home and their usefulness in supplementing genealogical research. Genealogical DNA tests allow for an individual to determine with high accuracy whether he or she is related to another person within a certain time frame, or with certainty that he or she is not related. DNA tests are perceived as more scientific, conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records. However, they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied. The civil records are always only as accurate as the individuals having provided or written the information.\n","Y-DNA testing results are normally stated as probabilities: For example, with the same surname a perfect 37/37 marker test match gives a 95% likelihood of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) being within 8 generations, while a 111 of 111 marker match gives the same 95% likelihood of the MRCA being within only 5 generations back.As presented above in mtDNA testing, if a perfect match is found, the mtDNA test results can be helpful. In some cases, research according to traditional genealogy methods encounters difficulties due to the lack of regularly recorded matrilineal surname information in many cultures (see Matrilineal surname).Autosomal DNA combined with genealogical research has been used by adoptees to find their biological parents, has been used to find the name and family of unidentified bodies and by law enforcement agencies to apprehend criminals (for example, the Contra Costa County District Attorney's office used the \"open-source\" genetic genealogy site GEDmatch to find relatives of the suspect in the Golden State Killer case.). The Atlantic magazine commented in 2018 that \"Now, the floodgates are open. ..a small, volunteer-run website, GEDmatch.com, has become ... the de facto DNA and genealogy database for all of law enforcement.\" Family Tree DNA announced in February 2019 it was allowing the FBI to access its DNA data for cases of murder and rape. However, in May 2019 GEDmatch initiated stricter rules for accessing their autosomal DNA database and Family Tree DNA shut down their Y-DNA database ysearch.org, making it more difficult for law enforcement agencies to solve cases.\n","\n","\n","== Drawbacks ==\n","Common concerns about genealogical DNA testing are cost and privacy issues. Some testing companies retain samples and results for their own use without a privacy agreement with subjects.Autosomal DNA tests can identify relationships but they can be misinterpreted. For example, transplants of stem cell or bone marrow will produce matches with the donor. In addition, identical twins (who have identical DNA) can give unexpected results.Testing of the Y-DNA lineage from father to son may reveal complications, due to unusual mutations, secret adoptions, and non-paternity events (i.e., that the perceived father in a generation is not the father indicated by written birth records). According to the Ancestry and Ancestry Testing Task Force of the American Society of Human Genetics, autosomal tests cannot detect \"large portions\" of DNA from distant ancestors because it has not been inherited.With the increasing popularity of the use of DNA tests for ethnicity tests, uncertainties and errors in ethnicity estimates are a drawback for Genetic genealogy. While ethnicity estimates at the continental level should be accurate (with the possible exception of East Asia and the Americas), sub-continental estimates, especially in Europe, are often inaccurate. Customers may be misinformed about the uncertainties and errors of the estimates.Some have recommended government or other regulation of ancestry testing to ensure its performance to an agreed standard.A number of law enforcement agencies took legal action to compel\n","genetic genealogy companies to release genetic information that could match cold case crime victims or perpetrators. A number of companies fought the requests.\n","\n","\n","== Medical information ==\n","Though genealogical DNA tests are not designed mainly for medical purposes, autosomal DNA tests can be used to analyze the probability of hundreds of heritable medical conditions, albeit the result is complex to understand and may confuse a non-expert.  23andMe provides medical and trait information from their genealogical DNA test and for a fee the Promethease web site analyses genealogical DNA test data from Family Tree DNA, 23andMe, or AncestryDNA for medical information. Promethease, and its research paper crawling database SNPedia, has received criticism for technical complexity and a poorly defined \"magnitude\" scale that causes misconceptions, confusion and panic among its users.The testing of full MtDNA and YDNA sequences is still somewhat controversial as it may reveal even more medical information. For example, a correlation exists between a lack of Y-DNA marker DYS464 and infertility, and between mtDNA haplogroup H and protection from sepsis. Certain haplogroups have been linked to longevity in some population groups. The field of linkage disequilibrium, unequal association of genetic disorders with a certain mitochondrial lineage, is in its infancy, but those mitochondrial mutations that have been linked are searchable in the genome database Mitomap. Family Tree DNA's MtFull Sequence test analyses the full MtDNA genome and the National Human Genome Research Institute operates the Genetic And Rare Disease Information Center that can assist consumers in identifying an appropriate screening test and help locate a nearby medical center that offers such a test.\n","\n","\n","== DNA in genealogy software ==\n","Some genealogy software programs – such as Family Tree Maker, Legacy Family Tree (Deluxe Edition) and the Swedish program Genney – allow recording DNA marker test results.

Since different testing companies use different ethnic reference groups and different matching algorithms, ethnicity estimates for an individual vary between tests, sometimes dramatically.\\nThree principal types of genealogical DNA tests are available, with each looking at a different part of the genome and being useful for different types of genealogical research: autosomal (atDNA), mitochondrial (mtDNA), and Y-DNA.\\nAutosomal tests may result in a large number of DNA matches to both males and females who have also tested with the same company. Each match will typically show an estimated degree of relatedness, i.e., a close family match, 1st-2nd cousins, 3rd-4th cousins, etc. The furthest degree of relationship is usually the \"6th-cousin or further\" level. However, due to the random nature of which, and how much, DNA is inherited by each tested person from their common ancestors, precise relationship conclusions can only be made for close relations. Traditional genealogical research, and the sharing of family trees, is typically required for interpretation of the results. Autosomal tests are also used in estimating ethnic mix.\\nMtDNA and Y-DNA tests are much more objective. However, they give considerably fewer DNA matches, if any (depending on the company doing the testing), since they are limited to relationships along a strict female line and a strict male line respectively.  MtDNA and Y-DNA tests are utilized to identify archeological cultures and migration paths of a person\\'s ancestors along a strict mother\\'s line or a strict father\\'s line. Based on MtDNA and Y-DNA, a person\\'s haplogroup(s) can be identified. The mtDNA test can be taken by both males and females, because everyone inherits their mtDNA from their mother, as the mitochondrial DNA is located in the egg cell. However, a Y-DNA test can only be taken by a male, as only males have a Y-chromosome.\\n\\n\\n== DNA testing for consumers ==\\nThe first company to provide direct-to-consumer genetic DNA testing was the now defunct GeneTree. However, it did not offer multi-generational genealogy tests. In fall 2001, GeneTree sold its assets to Salt Lake City-based Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation (SMGF) which originated in 1999.\\nWhile in operation, SMGF provided free Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA tests to thousands.\\nLater, GeneTree returned to genetic testing for genealogy in conjunction with the Sorenson parent company and eventually was part of the assets acquired in the Ancestry.com buyout of SMGF in 2012.In 2000, Family Tree DNA, founded by Bennett Greenspan and Max Blankfeld, was the first company dedicated to direct-to-consumer testing for genealogy research. They initially offered eleven-marker Y-Chromosome STR tests and HVR1 mitochondrial DNA tests. They originally tested in partnership with the University of Arizona.In 2007, 23andMe was the first company to offer a saliva-based direct-to-consumer genetic testing. It was also the first to implement the use of autosomal DNA for ancestry testing, which other major companies (e.g., Ancestry, Family Tree DNA, and MyHeritage) now use.MyHeritage launched its genetic testing service in 2016, allowing users to use cheek swabs to collect samples. In 2019, new analysis tools were presented: autoclusters (grouping all matches visually into clusters) and family tree theories (suggesting conceivable relations between DNA matches by combining several Myheritage trees as well as the Geni global family tree).Living DNA, founded in 2015, also provides a genetic testing service. Living DNA uses SNP chips to provide reports on autosomal ancestry, Y, and mtDNA ancestry. Living DNA provides detailed reports on ancestry from the UK as well as detailed Y chromosome and mtDNA reports.In 2019 it was estimated that large genealogical testing companies had about 26 million DNA profiles. Many transferred their test result for free to multiple testing sites, and also to genealogical services such as Geni.com and GEDmatch. GEDmatch said in 2018 that about half of their one million profiles were from the USA.The popular consciousness of DNA testing and of DNA generally is subject to a number of misconceptions involving the reliability of testing, the nature of the connections with one\\'s ancestors, the connection between DNA and personal traits, etc.\\n\\n\\n== Procedure ==\\n\\nA genealogical DNA test is performed on a DNA sample obtained by cheek-scraping (also known as a buccal swab), spit-cups, mouthwash, or chewing gum.  Typically, the sample collection uses a home test kit supplied by a service provider such as 23andMe, AncestryDNA, Family Tree DNA, or MyHeritage. After following the kit instructions on how to collect the sample, it is returned to the supplier for analysis. The sample is then processed using a technology known as DNA microarray to obtain the genetic information.\\n\\n\\n== Types of tests ==\\nThere are three major types of genealogical DNA tests: Autosomal (which includes X-DNA), Y-DNA, and mtDNA.\\n\\nAutosomal DNA tests look at chromosome pairs 1–22 and the X part of the 23rd chromosome. The autosomes (chromosome pairs 1–22) are inherited from both parents and all recent ancestors. The X-chromosome follows a special inheritance pattern, because females (XX) inherit an X-chromosome from each of their parents, while males (XY) inherit an X-chromosome from their mother and a Y-chromosome from their father (XY). Ethnicity estimates are often included with this sort of testing.\\nY-DNA looks at the Y-chromosome, which is passed down from father to son. Thus, the Y-DNA test can only be taken by males to explore their direct paternal line.\\nmtDNA looks at the mitochondria, which is passed down from mother to child. Thus, the mtDNA test can be taken by both males and females, and it explores one\\'s direct maternal line.Y-DNA and mtDNA cannot be used for ethnicity estimates, but can be used to find one\\'s haplogroup, which is unevenly distributed geographically. Direct-to-consumer DNA test companies have often labeled haplogroups by continent or ethnicity (e.g., an \"African haplogroup\" or a \"Viking haplogroup\"), but these labels may be speculative or misleading.\\n\\n\\n=== Autosomal DNA (atDNA) testing ===\\n\\n\\n==== Testing ====\\nAutosomal DNA is contained in the 22 pairs of chromosomes not involved in determining a person\\'s sex. Autosomal DNA recombines in each generation, and new offspring receive one set of chromosomes from each parent. These are inherited exactly equally from both parents and roughly equally from grandparents to about 3x great-grandparents. Therefore, the number of markers (one of two or more known variants in the genome at a particular location – known as Single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) inherited from a specific ancestor decreases by about half with each successive generation; that is, an individual receives half of their markers from each parent, about a quarter of those markers from each grandparent; about an eighth of those markers from each great-grandparent, etc. Inheritance is more random and unequal from more distant ancestors. Generally, a genealogical DNA test might test about 700,000 SNPs (specific points in the genome).\\n\\n\\n==== Reporting process ====\\nThe preparation of a report on the DNA in the sample proceeds in multiple stages:\\n\\nidentification of the DNA base pair at specific SNP locations\\ncomparison with previously stored results\\ninterpretation of matches\\n\\n\\n===== Base pair identification =====\\nAll major service providers use equipment with chips supplied by Illumina. The chip determines which SNP locations are tested. Different versions of the chip are used by different service providers. In addition, updated versions of the Illumina chip may test different sets of SNP locations. The list of SNP locations and base pairs at that location is usually available to the customer as \"raw data\". The raw data can sometimes be uploaded to another service provider to produce an additional interpretation and matches. For additional analysis the data can also be uploaded to GEDmatch (a third-party web based set of tools that analyzes raw data from the main service providers).\\n\\n\\n==== Identification of Matches ====\\nThe major component of an autosomal DNA test is matching other individuals. Where the individual being tested has a number of consecutive SNPs in common with a previously tested individual in the company\\'s database, it can be inferred that they share a segment of DNA at that part of their genomes. If the segment is longer than a threshold amount set by the testing company, then these two individuals are considered to be a match. Unlike the identification of base pairs, the data bases against which the new sample is tested, and the algorithms used to determine a match, are proprietary and specific to each company.\\nThe unit for segments of DNA is the centimorgan (cM). For comparison, a full human genome is about 6500 cM. The shorter the length of a match, the greater are the chances that a match is spurious. An important statistic for subsequent interpretation is the length of the shared DNA (or the percentage of the genome that is shared).\\n\\n\\n==== Interpretation of Autosomal matches ====\\nMost companies will show the customers how many cMs they share and across how many segments. From the number of cMs and segments, the relationship between the two individuals can be estimated; however, due to the random nature of DNA inheritance, relationship estimates, especially for distant relatives, are only approximate. Some more distant cousins will not match at all. Although information about specific SNPs can be used for some purposes (e.g., suggesting likely eye color), the key information is the percentage of DNA shared by two individuals. This can indicate the closeness of the relationship. However, it does not show the roles of the two individuals, e.g., 50% shared suggests a parent/child relationship, but it does not identify which individual is the parent.\\nVarious advanced techniques and analyses can be done on this data. This includes features such as In-common/Shared Matches, Chromosome Browsers, and Triangulation. This analysis is often required if DNA evidence is being used to prove or disprove a specific relationship.\\n\\n\\n=== X-chromosome DNA testing ===\\nThe X-chromosome SNP results are often included in autosomal DNA tests.  Both males and females receive an X-chromosome from their mother, but only females receive a second X-chromosome from their father. The X-chromosome has a special path of inheritance patterns and can be useful in significantly narrowing down possible ancestor lines compared to autosomal DNA. For example, an X-chromosome match with a male can only have come from his maternal side. Like autosomal DNA, X-chromosome DNA undergoes random recombination at each generation (except for father-to-daughter X-chromosomes, which are passed down unchanged). There are specialized inheritance charts which describe the possible patterns of X-chromosome DNA inheritance for males and females.\\n\\n\\n=== STRs ===\\nSome genealogical companies offer autosomal STRs (short tandem repeats). These are similar to Y-DNA STRs. The number of STRs offered is limited, and results have been used for personal identification, paternity cases, and inter-population studies.Law enforcement agencies in the US and Europe use autosomal STR data to identify criminals.\\n\\n\\n=== Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing ===\\nThe mitochondrion is a component of a human cell, and contains its own DNA. Mitochondrial DNA usually has 16,569 base pairs (the number can vary slightly depending on addition or deletion mutations) and is much smaller than the human genome DNA which has 3.2 billion base pairs.  Mitochondrial DNA is transmitted from mother to child, as it is contained in the egg cell. Thus, a direct maternal ancestor can be traced using mtDNA. The transmission occurs with relatively rare mutations compared to autosomal DNA. A perfect match found to another person\\'s mtDNA test results indicates shared ancestry of possibly between 1 and 50 generations ago. More distant matching to a specific haplogroup or subclade may be linked to a common geographic origin.\\n\\n\\n==== Test ====\\nThe mtDNA, by current conventions, is divided into three regions. They are the coding region (00577-16023) and two Hyper Variable Regions (HVR1 [16024-16569], and HVR2 [00001-00576]).The two most common mtDNA tests are a sequence of HVR1 and HVR2 and a full sequence of the mitochondria. Generally, testing only the HVRs has limited genealogical use so it is increasingly popular and accessible to have a full sequence. The full mtDNA sequence is only offered by Family Tree DNA among the major testing companies and is somewhat controversial because the coding region DNA may reveal medical information about the test-taker\\n\\n\\n==== Haplogroups ====\\n\\nAll humans descend in the direct female line from Mitochondrial Eve, a female who lived probably around 150,000 years ago in Africa. Different branches of her descendants are different haplogroups. Most mtDNA results include a prediction or exact assertion of one\\'s mtDNA Haplogroup. Mitochrondial haplogroups were greatly popularized by the book The Seven Daughters of Eve, which explores mitochondrial DNA.\\n\\n\\n==== Understanding mtDNA test results ====\\nIt is not normal for test results to give a base-by-base list of results. Instead, results are normally compared to the Cambridge Reference Sequence (CRS), which is the mitochondria of a European who was the first person to have their mtDNA published in 1981 (and revised in 1999). Differences between the CRS and testers are usually very few, thus it is more convenient than listing one\\'s raw results for each base pair.\\n\\nExamples\\nNote that in HVR1, instead of reporting the base pair exactly, for example 16,111, the 16 is often removed to give in this example 111. The letters refer to one of the four bases (A, T, G, C) that make up DNA.\\n\\n\\n=== Y-chromosome (Y-DNA) testing ===\\nThe Y-chromosome is one of the 23rd pair of human chromosomes. Only males have a Y-chromosome, because women have two X chromosomes in their 23rd pair. A man\\'s patrilineal ancestry, or male-line ancestry, can be traced using the DNA on his Y-chromosome (Y-DNA), because the Y-chromosome is transmitted from a father to son nearly unchanged. A man\\'s test results are compared to another man\\'s results to determine the time frame in which the two individuals shared a most recent common ancestor, or MRCA, in their direct patrilineal lines. If their test results are very close, they are related within a genealogically useful time frame. A surname project is where many individuals whose Y-chromosomes match collaborate to find their common ancestry.\\nWomen who wish to determine their direct paternal DNA ancestry can ask their father, brother, paternal uncle, paternal grandfather, or a paternal uncle\\'s son (their cousin) to take a test for them.\\nThere are two types of DNA testing: STRs and SNPs.\\n\\n\\n==== STR markers ====\\nMost common is STRs (short tandem repeat). A certain section of DNA is examined for a pattern that repeats (e.g. ATCG). The number of times it repeats is the value of the marker. Typical tests test between 12 and 111 STR markers. STRs mutate fairly frequently. The results of two individuals are then compared to see if there is a match. DNA companies will usually provide an estimate of how closely related two people are, in terms of generations or years, based on the difference between their results.\\n\\n\\n==== SNP markers and Haplogroups ====\\nA person\\'s haplogroup can often be inferred from their STR results, but can be proven only with a Y-chromosome SNP test (Y-SNP test).\\nA single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a change to a single nucleotide in a DNA sequence. Typical Y-DNA SNP tests test about 20,000 to 35,000 SNPs. Getting a SNP test allows a much higher resolution than STRs. It can be used to provide additional information about the relationship between two individuals and to confirm haplogroups.\\nAll human men descend in the paternal line from a single man dubbed Y-chromosomal Adam, who lived probably between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago. A \\'family tree\\' can be drawn showing how men today descend from him. Different branches of this tree are different haplogroups. Most haplogroups can be further subdivided multiple times into sub-clades. Some known sub-clades were founded in the last 1000 years, meaning their timeframe approaches the genealogical era (c.1500 onwards).New sub-clades of haplogroups may be discovered when an individual tests, especially if they are non-European. Most significant of these new discoveries was in 2013 when the haplogroup A00 was discovered, which required theories about Y-chromosomal Adam to be significantly revised. The haplogroup was discovered when an African-American man tested STRs at FamilyTreeDNA and his results were found to be unusual. SNP testing confirmed that he does not descend patrilineally from the \"old\" Y-chromosomal Adam and so a much older man became Y-Chromosomal Adam.\\n\\n\\n=== Using DNA test results ===\\n\\n\\n==== Ethnicity estimates ====\\nMany companies offer a percentage breakdown by ethnicity or region. Generally the world is specified into about 20–25 regions, and the approximate percentage of DNA inherited from each is stated. This is usually done by comparing the frequency of each Autosomal DNA marker tested to many population groups. The reliability of this type of test is dependent on comparative population size, the number of markers tested, the ancestry informative value of the SNPs tested, and the degree of admixture in the person tested. Earlier ethnicity estimates were often wildly inaccurate, but as companies receive more samples over time, ethnicity estimates have become more accurate. Testing companies such as Ancestry.com will often regularly update their ethnicity estimates, which has caused some controversy from customers as their results update. Usually the results at the continental level are accurate, but more specific assertions of the test may turn out to be incorrect.\\n\\n\\n== Audience ==\\nThe interest in genealogical DNA tests has been linked to both an increase in curiosity about traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins. Those who test for traditional genealogy often utilize a combination of autosomal, mitochondrial, and Y-Chromosome tests. Those with an interest in personal ethnic origins are more likely to use an autosomal test. However, answering specific questions about the ethnic origins of a particular lineage may be best suited to an mtDNA test or a Y-DNA test.\\n\\n\\n=== Maternal origin tests ===\\nFor recent genealogy, exact matching on the mtDNA full sequence is used to confirm a common ancestor on the direct maternal line between two suspected relatives. Because mtDNA mutations are very rare, a nearly perfect match is not usually considered relevant to the most recent 1 to 16 generations. In cultures lacking matrilineal surnames to pass down, neither relative above is likely to have as many generations of ancestors in their matrilineal information table as in the above patrilineal or Y-DNA case: for further information on this difficulty in traditional genealogy, due to lack of matrilineal surnames (or matrinames), see Matriname. However, the foundation of testing is still two suspected descendants of one person. This hypothesize and test DNA pattern is the same one used for autosomal DNA and Y-DNA.\\n\\n\\n=== Tests for ethnicity and membership of other groups ===\\n\\nAs discussed above, autosomal tests usually report the ethnic proportions of the individual. These attempt to measure an individual\\'s mixed geographic heritage by identifying particular markers, called ancestry informative markers or AIM, that are associated with populations of specific geographical areas. Geneticist Adam Rutherford has written that these tests \"don’t necessarily show your geographical origins in the past. They show with whom you have common ancestry today.\"The haplogroups determined by Y-DNA and mtDNA tests are often unevenly geographically distributed. Many direct-to-consumer DNA tests described this association to infer the test-taker\\'s ancestral homeland. Most tests describe haplogroups according to their most frequently associated continent (e.g., a \"European haplogroup\"). When Leslie Emery and collaborators performed a trial of mtDNA haplogroups as a predictor of continental origin on individuals in the Human Genetic Diversity Panel (HGDP) and 1000 Genomes (1KGP) datasets, they found that only 14 of 23 haplogroups had a success rate above 50% among the HGDP samples, as did \"about half\" of the haplogroups in the 1KGP. The authors concluded that, for most people, \"mtDNA-haplogroup membership provides limited information about either continental ancestry or continental region of origin.\"\\n\\n\\n==== African ancestry ====\\nY-DNA and mtDNA testing may be able to determine with which peoples in present-day Africa a person shares a direct line of part of his or her ancestry, but patterns of historic migration and historical events cloud the tracing of ancestral groups. Due to joint long histories in the US, approximately 30% of African American males have a European Y-Chromosome haplogroup Approximately 58% of African Americans have at least the equivalent of one great-grandparent (13%) of European ancestry. Only about 5% have the equivalent of one great-grandparent of Native American ancestry. By the early 19th century, substantial families of Free Persons of Color had been established in the Chesapeake Bay area who were descended from free people during the colonial period; most of those have been documented as descended from white men and African women (servant, slave or free). Over time various groups married more within mixed-race, black or white communities.According to authorities like Salas, nearly three-quarters of the ancestors of African Americans taken in slavery came from regions of West Africa. The African-American movement to discover and identify with ancestral tribes has burgeoned since DNA testing became available. African Americans usually cannot easily trace their ancestry during the years of slavery through surname research, census and property records, and other traditional means. Genealogical DNA testing may provide a tie to regional African heritage.\\n\\n\\n==== United States – Melungeon testing ====\\n\\nMelungeons are one of numerous multiracial groups in the United States with origins wrapped in myth. The historical research of Paul Heinegg has documented that many of the Melungeon groups in the Upper South were descended from mixed-race people who were free in colonial Virginia and the result of unions between the Europeans and Africans. They moved to the frontiers of Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee to gain some freedom from the racial barriers of the plantation areas. Several efforts, including a number of ongoing studies, have examined the genetic makeup of families historically identified as Melungeon. Most results point primarily to a mixture of European and African, which is supported by historical documentation. Some may have Native American heritage as well. Though some companies provide additional Melungeon research materials with Y-DNA and mtDNA tests, any test will allow comparisons with the results of current and past Melungeon DNA studies\\n\\n\\n==== Native American ancestry ====\\n\\nThe pre-columbian indigenous people of the United States are called \"Native Americans\" in American English. Autosomal testing, Y-DNA, and mtDNA testing can be conducted to determine the ancestry of Native Americans. A mitochondrial Haplogroup determination test based on mutations in Hypervariable Region 1 and 2 may establish whether a person\\'s direct female line belongs to one of the canonical Native American Haplogroups, A, B, C, D or X. The vast majority of Native American individuals belong to one of the five identified mtDNA Haplogroups. Thus, being in one of those groups provides evidence of potential Native American descent. However, DNA ethnicity results cannot be used as a substitute for legal documentation. Native American tribes have their own requirements for membership, often based on at least one of a person\\'s ancestors having been included on tribal-specific Native American censuses (or final rolls) prepared during treaty-making, relocation to reservations or apportionment of land in the late 19th century and early 20th century. One example is the Dawes Rolls.\\n\\n\\n==== Cohanim ancestry ====\\n\\nThe Cohanim (or Kohanim) is a patrilineal priestly line of descent in Judaism. According to the Bible, the ancestor of the Cohanim is Aaron, brother of Moses. Many believe that descent from Aaron is verifiable with a Y-DNA test: the first published study in genealogical Y-Chromosome DNA testing found that a significant percentage of Cohens had distinctively similar DNA, rather more so than general Jewish or Middle Eastern populations. These Cohens tended to belong to Haplogroup J, with Y-STR values clustered unusually closely around a haplotype known as the Cohen Modal Haplotype (CMH). This could be consistent with a shared common ancestor, or with the hereditary priesthood having originally been founded from members of a single closely related clan.\\nNevertheless, the original studies tested only six Y-STR markers, which is considered a low-resolution test. In response to the low resolution of the original 6-marker CMH, the testing company FTDNA released a 12-marker CMH signature that was more specific to the large closely related group of Cohens in Haplogroup J1.\\nA further academic study published in 2009 examined more STR markers and identified a more sharply defined SNP haplogroup, J1e* (now J1c3, also called J-P58*) for the J1 lineage. The research found \"that 46.1% of Kohanim carry Y chromosomes belonging to a single paternal lineage (J-P58*) that likely originated in the Near East well before the dispersal of Jewish groups in the Diaspora. Support for a Near Eastern origin of this lineage comes from its high frequency in our sample of Bedouins, Yemenis (67%), and Jordanians (55%) and its precipitous drop in frequency as one moves away from Saudi Arabia and the Near East (Fig. 4). Moreover, there is a striking contrast between the relatively high frequency of J-58* in Jewish populations (»20%) and Kohanim (»46%) and its vanishingly low frequency in our sample of non-Jewish populations that hosted Jewish diaspora communities outside of the Near East.\"Recent phylogenetic research for haplogroup J-M267 placed the \"Y-chromosomal Aaron\" in a subhaplogroup of J-L862, L147.1 (age estimate 5631-6778yBP yBP): YSC235>PF4847/CTS11741>YSC234>ZS241>ZS227>Z18271 (age estimate 2731yBP).\\n\\n\\n==== European testing ====\\n\\n\\n== Benefits ==\\n\\nGenealogical DNA tests have become popular due to the ease of testing at home and their usefulness in supplementing genealogical research. Genealogical DNA tests allow for an individual to determine with high accuracy whether he or she is related to another person within a certain time frame, or with certainty that he or she is not related. DNA tests are perceived as more scientific, conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records. However, they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied. The civil records are always only as accurate as the individuals having provided or written the information.\\nY-DNA testing results are normally stated as probabilities: For example, with the same surname a perfect 37/37 marker test match gives a 95% likelihood of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) being within 8 generations, while a 111 of 111 marker match gives the same 95% likelihood of the MRCA being within only 5 generations back.As presented above in mtDNA testing, if a perfect match is found, the mtDNA test results can be helpful. In some cases, research according to traditional genealogy methods encounters difficulties due to the lack of regularly recorded matrilineal surname information in many cultures (see Matrilineal surname).Autosomal DNA combined with genealogical research has been used by adoptees to find their biological parents, has been used to find the name and family of unidentified bodies and by law enforcement agencies to apprehend criminals (for example, the Contra Costa County District Attorney\\'s office used the \"open-source\" genetic genealogy site GEDmatch to find relatives of the suspect in the Golden State Killer case.). The Atlantic magazine commented in 2018 that \"Now, the floodgates are open. ..a small, volunteer-run website, GEDmatch.com, has become ... the de facto DNA and genealogy database for all of law enforcement.\" Family Tree DNA announced in February 2019 it was allowing the FBI to access its DNA data for cases of murder and rape. However, in May 2019 GEDmatch initiated stricter rules for accessing their autosomal DNA database and Family Tree DNA shut down their Y-DNA database ysearch.org, making it more difficult for law enforcement agencies to solve cases.\\n\\n\\n== Drawbacks ==\\nCommon concerns about genealogical DNA testing are cost and privacy issues. Some testing companies retain samples and results for their own use without a privacy agreement with subjects.Autosomal DNA tests can identify relationships but they can be misinterpreted. For example, transplants of stem cell or bone marrow will produce matches with the donor. In addition, identical twins (who have identical DNA) can give unexpected results.Testing of the Y-DNA lineage from father to son may reveal complications, due to unusual mutations, secret adoptions, and non-paternity events (i.e., that the perceived father in a generation is not the father indicated by written birth records). According to the Ancestry and Ancestry Testing Task Force of the American Society of Human Genetics, autosomal tests cannot detect \"large portions\" of DNA from distant ancestors because it has not been inherited.With the increasing popularity of the use of DNA tests for ethnicity tests, uncertainties and errors in ethnicity estimates are a drawback for Genetic genealogy. While ethnicity estimates at the continental level should be accurate (with the possible exception of East Asia and the Americas), sub-continental estimates, especially in Europe, are often inaccurate. Customers may be misinformed about the uncertainties and errors of the estimates.Some have recommended government or other regulation of ancestry testing to ensure its performance to an agreed standard.A number of law enforcement agencies took legal action to compel\\ngenetic genealogy companies to release genetic information that could match cold case crime victims or perpetrators. A number of companies fought the requests.\\n\\n\\n== Medical information ==\\nThough genealogical DNA tests are not designed mainly for medical purposes, autosomal DNA tests can be used to analyze the probability of hundreds of heritable medical conditions, albeit the result is complex to understand and may confuse a non-expert.  23andMe provides medical and trait information from their genealogical DNA test and for a fee the Promethease web site analyses genealogical DNA test data from Family Tree DNA, 23andMe, or AncestryDNA for medical information. Promethease, and its research paper crawling database SNPedia, has received criticism for technical complexity and a poorly defined \"magnitude\" scale that causes misconceptions, confusion and panic among its users.The testing of full MtDNA and YDNA sequences is still somewhat controversial as it may reveal even more medical information. For example, a correlation exists between a lack of Y-DNA marker DYS464 and infertility, and between mtDNA haplogroup H and protection from sepsis. Certain haplogroups have been linked to longevity in some population groups. The field of linkage disequilibrium, unequal association of genetic disorders with a certain mitochondrial lineage, is in its infancy, but those mitochondrial mutations that have been linked are searchable in the genome database Mitomap. Family Tree DNA\\'s MtFull Sequence test analyses the full MtDNA genome and the National Human Genome Research Institute operates the Genetic And Rare Disease Information Center that can assist consumers in identifying an appropriate screening test and help locate a nearby medical center that offers such a test.\\n\\n\\n== DNA in genealogy software ==\\nSome genealogy software programs – such as Family Tree Maker, Legacy Family Tree (Deluxe Edition) and the Swedish program Genney – allow recording DNA marker test results. This allows for tracking of both Y-chromosome and mtDNA tests, and recording results for relatives.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nY-Haplogroups brief descriptions and regional origins'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":65}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Convertimos todo a minúsculas"],"metadata":{"id":"7Zfi-YVsUOmH"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["wiki_topic_content = wiki_topic.content.lower()\n","wiki_topic_content"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":105},"id":"-Ho_oQ7-Lted","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1652479204216,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":437,"user":{"displayName":"David E.

genealogical dna test is a dna-based test used in genetic genealogy that looks at specific locations of a person\\'s genome in order to find or verify ancestral genealogical relationships, or (with lower reliability) to estimate the ethnic mixture of an individual. since different testing companies use different ethnic reference groups and different matching algorithms, ethnicity estimates for an individual vary between tests, sometimes dramatically.\\nthree principal types of genealogical dna tests are available, with each looking at a different part of the genome and being useful for different types of genealogical research: autosomal (atdna), mitochondrial (mtdna), and y-dna.\\nautosomal tests may result in a large number of dna matches to both males and females who have also tested with the same company. each match will typically show an estimated degree of relatedness, i.e., a close family match, 1st-2nd cousins, 3rd-4th cousins, etc. the furthest degree of relationship is usually the \"6th-cousin or further\" level. however, due to the random nature of which, and how much, dna is inherited by each tested person from their common ancestors, precise relationship conclusions can only be made for close relations. traditional genealogical research, and the sharing of family trees, is typically required for interpretation of the results. autosomal tests are also used in estimating ethnic mix.\\nmtdna and y-dna tests are much more objective. however, they give considerably fewer dna matches, if any (depending on the company doing the testing), since they are limited to relationships along a strict female line and a strict male line respectively.  mtdna and y-dna tests are utilized to identify archeological cultures and migration paths of a person\\'s ancestors along a strict mother\\'s line or a strict father\\'s line. based on mtdna and y-dna, a person\\'s haplogroup(s) can be identified. the mtdna test can be taken by both males and females, because everyone inherits their mtdna from their mother, as the mitochondrial dna is located in the egg cell. however, a y-dna test can only be taken by a male, as only males have a y-chromosome.\\n\\n\\n== dna testing for consumers ==\\nthe first company to provide direct-to-consumer genetic dna testing was the now defunct genetree. however, it did not offer multi-generational genealogy tests. in fall 2001, genetree sold its assets to salt lake city-based sorenson molecular genealogy foundation (smgf) which originated in 1999.\\nwhile in operation, smgf provided free y-chromosome and mitochondrial dna tests to thousands.\\nlater, genetree returned to genetic testing for genealogy in conjunction with the sorenson parent company and eventually was part of the assets acquired in the ancestry.com buyout of smgf in 2012.in 2000, family tree dna, founded by bennett greenspan and max blankfeld, was the first company dedicated to direct-to-consumer testing for genealogy research. they initially offered eleven-marker y-chromosome str tests and hvr1 mitochondrial dna tests. they originally tested in partnership with the university of arizona.in 2007, 23andme was the first company to offer a saliva-based direct-to-consumer genetic testing. it was also the first to implement the use of autosomal dna for ancestry testing, which other major companies (e.g., ancestry, family tree dna, and myheritage) now use.myheritage launched its genetic testing service in 2016, allowing users to use cheek swabs to collect samples. in 2019, new analysis tools were presented: autoclusters (grouping all matches visually into clusters) and family tree theories (suggesting conceivable relations between dna matches by combining several myheritage trees as well as the geni global family tree).living dna, founded in 2015, also provides a genetic testing service. living dna uses snp chips to provide reports on autosomal ancestry, y, and mtdna ancestry. living dna provides detailed reports on ancestry from the uk as well as detailed y chromosome and mtdna reports.in 2019 it was estimated that large genealogical testing companies had about 26 million dna profiles. many transferred their test result for free to multiple testing sites, and also to genealogical services such as geni.com and gedmatch. gedmatch said in 2018 that about half of their one million profiles were from the usa.the popular consciousness of dna testing and of dna generally is subject to a number of misconceptions involving the reliability of testing, the nature of the connections with one\\'s ancestors, the connection between dna and personal traits, etc.\\n\\n\\n== procedure ==\\n\\na genealogical dna test is performed on a dna sample obtained by cheek-scraping (also known as a buccal swab), spit-cups, mouthwash, or chewing gum.  typically, the sample collection uses a home test kit supplied by a service provider such as 23andme, ancestrydna, family tree dna, or myheritage. after following the kit instructions on how to collect the sample, it is returned to the supplier for analysis. the sample is then processed using a technology known as dna microarray to obtain the genetic information.\\n\\n\\n== types of tests ==\\nthere are three major types of genealogical dna tests: autosomal (which includes x-dna), y-dna, and mtdna.\\n\\nautosomal dna tests look at chromosome pairs 1–22 and the x part of the 23rd chromosome. the autosomes (chromosome pairs 1–22) are inherited from both parents and all recent ancestors. the x-chromosome follows a special inheritance pattern, because females (xx) inherit an x-chromosome from each of their parents, while males (xy) inherit an x-chromosome from their mother and a y-chromosome from their father (xy). ethnicity estimates are often included with this sort of testing.\\ny-dna looks at the y-chromosome, which is passed down from father to son. thus, the y-dna test can only be taken by males to explore their direct paternal line.\\nmtdna looks at the mitochondria, which is passed down from mother to child. thus, the mtdna test can be taken by both males and females, and it explores one\\'s direct maternal line.y-dna and mtdna cannot be used for ethnicity estimates, but can be used to find one\\'s haplogroup, which is unevenly distributed geographically. direct-to-consumer dna test companies have often labeled haplogroups by continent or ethnicity (e.g., an \"african haplogroup\" or a \"viking haplogroup\"), but these labels may be speculative or misleading.\\n\\n\\n=== autosomal dna (atdna) testing ===\\n\\n\\n==== testing ====\\nautosomal dna is contained in the 22 pairs of chromosomes not involved in determining a person\\'s sex. autosomal dna recombines in each generation, and new offspring receive one set of chromosomes from each parent. these are inherited exactly equally from both parents and roughly equally from grandparents to about 3x great-grandparents. therefore, the number of markers (one of two or more known variants in the genome at a particular location – known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms or snps) inherited from a specific ancestor decreases by about half with each successive generation; that is, an individual receives half of their markers from each parent, about a quarter of those markers from each grandparent; about an eighth of those markers from each great-grandparent, etc. inheritance is more random and unequal from more distant ancestors. generally, a genealogical dna test might test about 700,000 snps (specific points in the genome).\\n\\n\\n==== reporting process ====\\nthe preparation of a report on the dna in the sample proceeds in multiple stages:\\n\\nidentification of the dna base pair at specific snp locations\\ncomparison with previously stored results\\ninterpretation of matches\\n\\n\\n===== base pair identification =====\\nall major service providers use equipment with chips supplied by illumina. the chip determines which snp locations are tested. different versions of the chip are used by different service providers. in addition, updated versions of the illumina chip may test different sets of snp locations. the list of snp locations and base pairs at that location is usually available to the customer as \"raw data\". the raw data can sometimes be uploaded to another service provider to produce an additional interpretation and matches. for additional analysis the data can also be uploaded to gedmatch (a third-party web based set of tools that analyzes raw data from the main service providers).\\n\\n\\n==== identification of matches ====\\nthe major component of an autosomal dna test is matching other individuals. where the individual being tested has a number of consecutive snps in common with a previously tested individual in the company\\'s database, it can be inferred that they share a segment of dna at that part of their genomes. if the segment is longer than a threshold amount set by the testing company, then these two individuals are considered to be a match. unlike the identification of base pairs, the data bases against which the new sample is tested, and the algorithms used to determine a match, are proprietary and specific to each company.\\nthe unit for segments of dna is the centimorgan (cm). for comparison, a full human genome is about 6500 cm. the shorter the length of a match, the greater are the chances that a match is spurious. an important statistic for subsequent interpretation is the length of the shared dna (or the percentage of the genome that is shared).\\n\\n\\n==== interpretation of autosomal matches ====\\nmost companies will show the customers how many cms they share and across how many segments. from the number of cms and segments, the relationship between the two individuals can be estimated; however, due to the random nature of dna inheritance, relationship estimates, especially for distant relatives, are only approximate. some more distant cousins will not match at all. although information about specific snps can be used for some purposes (e.g., suggesting likely eye color), the key information is the percentage of dna shared by two individuals. this can indicate the closeness of the relationship. however, it does not show the roles of the two individuals, e.g., 50% shared suggests a parent/child relationship, but it does not identify which individual is the parent.\\nvarious advanced techniques and analyses can be done on this data. this includes features such as in-common/shared matches, chromosome browsers, and triangulation. this analysis is often required if dna evidence is being used to prove or disprove a specific relationship.\\n\\n\\n=== x-chromosome dna testing ===\\nthe x-chromosome snp results are often included in autosomal dna tests.  both males and females receive an x-chromosome from their mother, but only females receive a second x-chromosome from their father. the x-chromosome has a special path of inheritance patterns and can be useful in significantly narrowing down possible ancestor lines compared to autosomal dna. for example, an x-chromosome match with a male can only have come from his maternal side. like autosomal dna, x-chromosome dna undergoes random recombination at each generation (except for father-to-daughter x-chromosomes, which are passed down unchanged). there are specialized inheritance charts which describe the possible patterns of x-chromosome dna inheritance for males and females.\\n\\n\\n=== strs ===\\nsome genealogical companies offer autosomal strs (short tandem repeats). these are similar to y-dna strs. the number of strs offered is limited, and results have been used for personal identification, paternity cases, and inter-population studies.law enforcement agencies in the us and europe use autosomal str data to identify criminals.\\n\\n\\n=== mitochondrial dna (mtdna) testing ===\\nthe mitochondrion is a component of a human cell, and contains its own dna. mitochondrial dna usually has 16,569 base pairs (the number can vary slightly depending on addition or deletion mutations) and is much smaller than the human genome dna which has 3.2 billion base pairs.  mitochondrial dna is transmitted from mother to child, as it is contained in the egg cell. thus, a direct maternal ancestor can be traced using mtdna. the transmission occurs with relatively rare mutations compared to autosomal dna. a perfect match found to another person\\'s mtdna test results indicates shared ancestry of possibly between 1 and 50 generations ago. more distant matching to a specific haplogroup or subclade may be linked to a common geographic origin.\\n\\n\\n==== test ====\\nthe mtdna, by current conventions, is divided into three regions. they are the coding region (00577-16023) and two hyper variable regions (hvr1 [16024-16569], and hvr2 [00001-00576]).the two most common mtdna tests are a sequence of hvr1 and hvr2 and a full sequence of the mitochondria. generally, testing only the hvrs has limited genealogical use so it is increasingly popular and accessible to have a full sequence. the full mtdna sequence is only offered by family tree dna among the major testing companies and is somewhat controversial because the coding region dna may reveal medical information about the test-taker\\n\\n\\n==== haplogroups ====\\n\\nall humans descend in the direct female line from mitochondrial eve, a female who lived probably around 150,000 years ago in africa. different branches of her descendants are different haplogroups. most mtdna results include a prediction or exact assertion of one\\'s mtdna haplogroup. mitochrondial haplogroups were greatly popularized by the book the seven daughters of eve, which explores mitochondrial dna.\\n\\n\\n==== understanding mtdna test results ====\\nit is not normal for test results to give a base-by-base list of results. instead, results are normally compared to the cambridge reference sequence (crs), which is the mitochondria of a european who was the first person to have their mtdna published in 1981 (and revised in 1999). differences between the crs and testers are usually very few, thus it is more convenient than listing one\\'s raw results for each base pair.\\n\\nexamples\\nnote that in hvr1, instead of reporting the base pair exactly, for example 16,111, the 16 is often removed to give in this example 111. the letters refer to one of the four bases (a, t, g, c) that make up dna.\\n\\n\\n=== y-chromosome (y-dna) testing ===\\nthe y-chromosome is one of the 23rd pair of human chromosomes. only males have a y-chromosome, because women have two x chromosomes in their 23rd pair. a man\\'s patrilineal ancestry, or male-line ancestry, can be traced using the dna on his y-chromosome (y-dna), because the y-chromosome is transmitted from a father to son nearly unchanged. a man\\'s test results are compared to another man\\'s results to determine the time frame in which the two individuals shared a most recent common ancestor, or mrca, in their direct patrilineal lines. if their test results are very close, they are related within a genealogically useful time frame. a surname project is where many individuals whose y-chromosomes match collaborate to find their common ancestry.\\nwomen who wish to determine their direct paternal dna ancestry can ask their father, brother, paternal uncle, paternal grandfather, or a paternal uncle\\'s son (their cousin) to take a test for them.\\nthere are two types of dna testing: strs and snps.\\n\\n\\n==== str markers ====\\nmost common is strs (short tandem repeat). a certain section of dna is examined for a pattern that repeats (e.g. atcg). the number of times it repeats is the value of the marker. typical tests test between 12 and 111 str markers. strs mutate fairly frequently. the results of two individuals are then compared to see if there is a match. dna companies will usually provide an estimate of how closely related two people are, in terms of generations or years, based on the difference between their results.\\n\\n\\n==== snp markers and haplogroups ====\\na person\\'s haplogroup can often be inferred from their str results, but can be proven only with a y-chromosome snp test (y-snp test).\\na single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) is a change to a single nucleotide in a dna sequence. typical y-dna snp tests test about 20,000 to 35,000 snps. getting a snp test allows a much higher resolution than strs. it can be used to provide additional information about the relationship between two individuals and to confirm haplogroups.\\nall human men descend in the paternal line from a single man dubbed y-chromosomal adam, who lived probably between 200,000 and 300,000 years ago. a \\'family tree\\' can be drawn showing how men today descend from him. different branches of this tree are different haplogroups. most haplogroups can be further subdivided multiple times into sub-clades. some known sub-clades were founded in the last 1000 years, meaning their timeframe approaches the genealogical era (c.1500 onwards).new sub-clades of haplogroups may be discovered when an individual tests, especially if they are non-european. most significant of these new discoveries was in 2013 when the haplogroup a00 was discovered, which required theories about y-chromosomal adam to be significantly revised. the haplogroup was discovered when an african-american man tested strs at familytreedna and his results were found to be unusual. snp testing confirmed that he does not descend patrilineally from the \"old\" y-chromosomal adam and so a much older man became y-chromosomal adam.\\n\\n\\n=== using dna test results ===\\n\\n\\n==== ethnicity estimates ====\\nmany companies offer a percentage breakdown by ethnicity or region. generally the world is specified into about 20–25 regions, and the approximate percentage of dna inherited from each is stated. this is usually done by comparing the frequency of each autosomal dna marker tested to many population groups. the reliability of this type of test is dependent on comparative population size, the number of markers tested, the ancestry informative value of the snps tested, and the degree of admixture in the person tested. earlier ethnicity estimates were often wildly inaccurate, but as companies receive more samples over time, ethnicity estimates have become more accurate. testing companies such as ancestry.com will often regularly update their ethnicity estimates, which has caused some controversy from customers as their results update. usually the results at the continental level are accurate, but more specific assertions of the test may turn out to be incorrect.\\n\\n\\n== audience ==\\nthe interest in genealogical dna tests has been linked to both an increase in curiosity about traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins. those who test for traditional genealogy often utilize a combination of autosomal, mitochondrial, and y-chromosome tests. those with an interest in personal ethnic origins are more likely to use an autosomal test. however, answering specific questions about the ethnic origins of a particular lineage may be best suited to an mtdna test or a y-dna test.\\n\\n\\n=== maternal origin tests ===\\nfor recent genealogy, exact matching on the mtdna full sequence is used to confirm a common ancestor on the direct maternal line between two suspected relatives. because mtdna mutations are very rare, a nearly perfect match is not usually considered relevant to the most recent 1 to 16 generations. in cultures lacking matrilineal surnames to pass down, neither relative above is likely to have as many generations of ancestors in their matrilineal information table as in the above patrilineal or y-dna case: for further information on this difficulty in traditional genealogy, due to lack of matrilineal surnames (or matrinames), see matriname. however, the foundation of testing is still two suspected descendants of one person. this hypothesize and test dna pattern is the same one used for autosomal dna and y-dna.\\n\\n\\n=== tests for ethnicity and membership of other groups ===\\n\\nas discussed above, autosomal tests usually report the ethnic proportions of the individual. these attempt to measure an individual\\'s mixed geographic heritage by identifying particular markers, called ancestry informative markers or aim, that are associated with populations of specific geographical areas. geneticist adam rutherford has written that these tests \"don’t necessarily show your geographical origins in the past. they show with whom you have common ancestry today.\"the haplogroups determined by y-dna and mtdna tests are often unevenly geographically distributed. many direct-to-consumer dna tests described this association to infer the test-taker\\'s ancestral homeland. most tests describe haplogroups according to their most frequently associated continent (e.g., a \"european haplogroup\"). when leslie emery and collaborators performed a trial of mtdna haplogroups as a predictor of continental origin on individuals in the human genetic diversity panel (hgdp) and 1000 genomes (1kgp) datasets, they found that only 14 of 23 haplogroups had a success rate above 50% among the hgdp samples, as did \"about half\" of the haplogroups in the 1kgp. the authors concluded that, for most people, \"mtdna-haplogroup membership provides limited information about either continental ancestry or continental region of origin.\"\\n\\n\\n==== african ancestry ====\\ny-dna and mtdna testing may be able to determine with which peoples in present-day africa a person shares a direct line of part of his or her ancestry, but patterns of historic migration and historical events cloud the tracing of ancestral groups. due to joint long histories in the us, approximately 30% of african american males have a european y-chromosome haplogroup approximately 58% of african americans have at least the equivalent of one great-grandparent (13%) of european ancestry. only about 5% have the equivalent of one great-grandparent of native american ancestry. by the early 19th century, substantial families of free persons of color had been established in the chesapeake bay area who were descended from free people during the colonial period; most of those have been documented as descended from white men and african women (servant, slave or free). over time various groups married more within mixed-race, black or white communities.according to authorities like salas, nearly three-quarters of the ancestors of african americans taken in slavery came from regions of west africa. the african-american movement to discover and identify with ancestral tribes has burgeoned since dna testing became available. african americans usually cannot easily trace their ancestry during the years of slavery through surname research, census and property records, and other traditional means. genealogical dna testing may provide a tie to regional african heritage.\\n\\n\\n==== united states – melungeon testing ====\\n\\nmelungeons are one of numerous multiracial groups in the united states with origins wrapped in myth. the historical research of paul heinegg has documented that many of the melungeon groups in the upper south were descended from mixed-race people who were free in colonial virginia and the result of unions between the europeans and africans. they moved to the frontiers of virginia, north carolina, kentucky and tennessee to gain some freedom from the racial barriers of the plantation areas. several efforts, including a number of ongoing studies, have examined the genetic makeup of families historically identified as melungeon. most results point primarily to a mixture of european and african, which is supported by historical documentation. some may have native american heritage as well. though some companies provide additional melungeon research materials with y-dna and mtdna tests, any test will allow comparisons with the results of current and past melungeon dna studies\\n\\n\\n==== native american ancestry ====\\n\\nthe pre-columbian indigenous people of the united states are called \"native americans\" in american english. autosomal testing, y-dna, and mtdna testing can be conducted to determine the ancestry of native americans. a mitochondrial haplogroup determination test based on mutations in hypervariable region 1 and 2 may establish whether a person\\'s direct female line belongs to one of the canonical native american haplogroups, a, b, c, d or x. the vast majority of native american individuals belong to one of the five identified mtdna haplogroups. thus, being in one of those groups provides evidence of potential native american descent. however, dna ethnicity results cannot be used as a substitute for legal documentation. native american tribes have their own requirements for membership, often based on at least one of a person\\'s ancestors having been included on tribal-specific native american censuses (or final rolls) prepared during treaty-making, relocation to reservations or apportionment of land in the late 19th century and early 20th century. one example is the dawes rolls.\\n\\n\\n==== cohanim ancestry ====\\n\\nthe cohanim (or kohanim) is a patrilineal priestly line of descent in judaism. according to the bible, the ancestor of the cohanim is aaron, brother of moses. many believe that descent from aaron is verifiable with a y-dna test: the first published study in genealogical y-chromosome dna testing found that a significant percentage of cohens had distinctively similar dna, rather more so than general jewish or middle eastern populations. these cohens tended to belong to haplogroup j, with y-str values clustered unusually closely around a haplotype known as the cohen modal haplotype (cmh). this could be consistent with a shared common ancestor, or with the hereditary priesthood having originally been founded from members of a single closely related clan.\\nnevertheless, the original studies tested only six y-str markers, which is considered a low-resolution test. in response to the low resolution of the original 6-marker cmh, the testing company ftdna released a 12-marker cmh signature that was more specific to the large closely related group of cohens in haplogroup j1.\\na further academic study published in 2009 examined more str markers and identified a more sharply defined snp haplogroup, j1e* (now j1c3, also called j-p58*) for the j1 lineage. the research found \"that 46.1% of kohanim carry y chromosomes belonging to a single paternal lineage (j-p58*) that likely originated in the near east well before the dispersal of jewish groups in the diaspora. support for a near eastern origin of this lineage comes from its high frequency in our sample of bedouins, yemenis (67%), and jordanians (55%) and its precipitous drop in frequency as one moves away from saudi arabia and the near east (fig. 4). moreover, there is a striking contrast between the relatively high frequency of j-58* in jewish populations (»20%) and kohanim (»46%) and its vanishingly low frequency in our sample of non-jewish populations that hosted jewish diaspora communities outside of the near east.\"recent phylogenetic research for haplogroup j-m267 placed the \"y-chromosomal aaron\" in a subhaplogroup of j-l862, l147.1 (age estimate 5631-6778ybp ybp): ysc235>pf4847/cts11741>ysc234>zs241>zs227>z18271 (age estimate 2731ybp).\\n\\n\\n==== european testing ====\\n\\n\\n== benefits ==\\n\\ngenealogical dna tests have become popular due to the ease of testing at home and their usefulness in supplementing genealogical research. genealogical dna tests allow for an individual to determine with high accuracy whether he or she is related to another person within a certain time frame, or with certainty that he or she is not related. dna tests are perceived as more scientific, conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records. however, they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied. the civil records are always only as accurate as the individuals having provided or written the information.\\ny-dna testing results are normally stated as probabilities: for example, with the same surname a perfect 37/37 marker test match gives a 95% likelihood of the most recent common ancestor (mrca) being within 8 generations, while a 111 of 111 marker match gives the same 95% likelihood of the mrca being within only 5 generations back.as presented above in mtdna testing, if a perfect match is found, the mtdna test results can be helpful. in some cases, research according to traditional genealogy methods encounters difficulties due to the lack of regularly recorded matrilineal surname information in many cultures (see matrilineal surname).autosomal dna combined with genealogical research has been used by adoptees to find their biological parents, has been used to find the name and family of unidentified bodies and by law enforcement agencies to apprehend criminals (for example, the contra costa county district attorney\\'s office used the \"open-source\" genetic genealogy site gedmatch to find relatives of the suspect in the golden state killer case.). the atlantic magazine commented in 2018 that \"now, the floodgates are open. ..a small, volunteer-run website, gedmatch.com, has become ... the de facto dna and genealogy database for all of law enforcement.\" family tree dna announced in february 2019 it was allowing the fbi to access its dna data for cases of murder and rape. however, in may 2019 gedmatch initiated stricter rules for accessing their autosomal dna database and family tree dna shut down their y-dna database ysearch.org, making it more difficult for law enforcement agencies to solve cases.\\n\\n\\n== drawbacks ==\\ncommon concerns about genealogical dna testing are cost and privacy issues. some testing companies retain samples and results for their own use without a privacy agreement with subjects.autosomal dna tests can identify relationships but they can be misinterpreted. for example, transplants of stem cell or bone marrow will produce matches with the donor. in addition, identical twins (who have identical dna) can give unexpected results.testing of the y-dna lineage from father to son may reveal complications, due to unusual mutations, secret adoptions, and non-paternity events (i.e., that the perceived father in a generation is not the father indicated by written birth records). according to the ancestry and ancestry testing task force of the american society of human genetics, autosomal tests cannot detect

genealogical dna test is a dna-based test used in genetic genealogy that looks at specific locations of a person\\'s genome in order to find or verify ancestral genealogical relationships, or (with lower reliability) to estimate the ethnic mixture of an individual. since different testing companies use different ethnic reference groups and different matching algorithms, ethnicity estimates for an individual vary between tests, sometimes dramatically.\\nthree principal types of genealogical dna tests are available, with each looking at a different part of the genome and being useful for different types of genealogical research: autosomal (atdna), mitochondrial (mtdna), and y-dna.\\nautosomal tests may result in a large number of dna matches to both males and females who have also tested with the same company. each match will typically show an estimated degree of relatedness, i.e., a close family match, st-nd cousins, rd-th cousins, etc. the furthest degree of relationship is usually the \"th-cousin or further\" level. however, due to the random nature of which, and how much, dna is inherited by each tested person from their common ancestors, precise relationship conclusions can only be made for close relations. traditional genealogical research, and the sharing of family trees, is typically required for interpretation of the results. autosomal tests are also used in estimating ethnic mix.\\nmtdna and y-dna tests are much more objective. however, they give considerably fewer dna matches, if any (depending on the company doing the testing), since they are limited to relationships along a strict female line and a strict male line respectively.  mtdna and y-dna tests are utilized to identify archeological cultures and migration paths of a person\\'s ancestors along a strict mother\\'s line or a strict father\\'s line. based on mtdna and y-dna, a person\\'s haplogroup(s) can be identified. the mtdna test can be taken by both males and females, because everyone inherits their mtdna from their mother, as the mitochondrial dna is located in the egg cell. however, a y-dna test can only be taken by a male, as only males have a y-chromosome.\\n\\n\\n== dna testing for consumers ==\\nthe first company to provide direct-to-consumer genetic dna testing was the now defunct genetree. however, it did not offer multi-generational genealogy tests. in fall , genetree sold its assets to salt lake city-based sorenson molecular genealogy foundation (smgf) which originated in .\\nwhile in operation, smgf provided free y-chromosome and mitochondrial dna tests to thousands.\\nlater, genetree returned to genetic testing for genealogy in conjunction with the sorenson parent company and eventually was part of the assets acquired in the ancestry.com buyout of smgf in .in , family tree dna, founded by bennett greenspan and max blankfeld, was the first company dedicated to direct-to-consumer testing for genealogy research. they initially offered eleven-marker y-chromosome str tests and hvr mitochondrial dna tests. they originally tested in partnership with the university of arizona.in , andme was the first company to offer a saliva-based direct-to-consumer genetic testing. it was also the first to implement the use of autosomal dna for ancestry testing, which other major companies (e.g., ancestry, family tree dna, and myheritage) now use.myheritage launched its genetic testing service in , allowing users to use cheek swabs to collect samples. in , new analysis tools were presented: autoclusters (grouping all matches visually into clusters) and family tree theories (suggesting conceivable relations between dna matches by combining several myheritage trees as well as the geni global family tree).living dna, founded in , also provides a genetic testing service. living dna uses snp chips to provide reports on autosomal ancestry, y, and mtdna ancestry. living dna provides detailed reports on ancestry from the uk as well as detailed y chromosome and mtdna reports.in  it was estimated that large genealogical testing companies had about  million dna profiles. many transferred their test result for free to multiple testing sites, and also to genealogical services such as geni.com and gedmatch. gedmatch said in  that about half of their one million profiles were from the usa.the popular consciousness of dna testing and of dna generally is subject to a number of misconceptions involving the reliability of testing, the nature of the connections with one\\'s ancestors, the connection between dna and personal traits, etc.\\n\\n\\n== procedure ==\\n\\na genealogical dna test is performed on a dna sample obtained by cheek-scraping (also known as a buccal swab), spit-cups, mouthwash, or chewing gum.  typically, the sample collection uses a home test kit supplied by a service provider such as andme, ancestrydna, family tree dna, or myheritage. after following the kit instructions on how to collect the sample, it is returned to the supplier for analysis. the sample is then processed using a technology known as dna microarray to obtain the genetic information.\\n\\n\\n== types of tests ==\\nthere are three major types of genealogical dna tests: autosomal (which includes x-dna), y-dna, and mtdna.\\n\\nautosomal dna tests look at chromosome pairs – and the x part of the rd chromosome. the autosomes (chromosome pairs –) are inherited from both parents and all recent ancestors. the x-chromosome follows a special inheritance pattern, because females (xx) inherit an x-chromosome from each of their parents, while males (xy) inherit an x-chromosome from their mother and a y-chromosome from their father (xy). ethnicity estimates are often included with this sort of testing.\\ny-dna looks at the y-chromosome, which is passed down from father to son. thus, the y-dna test can only be taken by males to explore their direct paternal line.\\nmtdna looks at the mitochondria, which is passed down from mother to child. thus, the mtdna test can be taken by both males and females, and it explores one\\'s direct maternal line.y-dna and mtdna cannot be used for ethnicity estimates, but can be used to find one\\'s haplogroup, which is unevenly distributed geographically. direct-to-consumer dna test companies have often labeled haplogroups by continent or ethnicity (e.g., an \"african haplogroup\" or a \"viking haplogroup\"), but these labels may be speculative or misleading.\\n\\n\\n=== autosomal dna (atdna) testing ===\\n\\n\\n==== testing ====\\nautosomal dna is contained in the  pairs of chromosomes not involved in determining a person\\'s sex. autosomal dna recombines in each generation, and new offspring receive one set of chromosomes from each parent. these are inherited exactly equally from both parents and roughly equally from grandparents to about x great-grandparents. therefore, the number of markers (one of two or more known variants in the genome at a particular location – known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms or snps) inherited from a specific ancestor decreases by about half with each successive generation; that is, an individual receives half of their markers from each parent, about a quarter of those markers from each grandparent; about an eighth of those markers from each great-grandparent, etc. inheritance is more random and unequal from more distant ancestors. generally, a genealogical dna test might test about , snps (specific points in the genome).\\n\\n\\n==== reporting process ====\\nthe preparation of a report on the dna in the sample proceeds in multiple stages:\\n\\nidentification of the dna base pair at specific snp locations\\ncomparison with previously stored results\\ninterpretation of matches\\n\\n\\n===== base pair identification =====\\nall major service providers use equipment with chips supplied by illumina. the chip determines which snp locations are tested. different versions of the chip are used by different service providers. in addition, updated versions of the illumina chip may test different sets of snp locations. the list of snp locations and base pairs at that location is usually available to the customer as \"raw data\". the raw data can sometimes be uploaded to another service provider to produce an additional interpretation and matches. for additional analysis the data can also be uploaded to gedmatch (a third-party web based set of tools that analyzes raw data from the main service providers).\\n\\n\\n==== identification of matches ====\\nthe major component of an autosomal dna test is matching other individuals. where the individual being tested has a number of consecutive snps in common with a previously tested individual in the company\\'s database, it can be inferred that they share a segment of dna at that part of their genomes. if the segment is longer than a threshold amount set by the testing company, then these two individuals are considered to be a match. unlike the identification of base pairs, the data bases against which the new sample is tested, and the algorithms used to determine a match, are proprietary and specific to each company.\\nthe unit for segments of dna is the centimorgan (cm). for comparison, a full human genome is about  cm. the shorter the length of a match, the greater are the chances that a match is spurious. an important statistic for subsequent interpretation is the length of the shared dna (or the percentage of the genome that is shared).\\n\\n\\n==== interpretation of autosomal matches ====\\nmost companies will show the customers how many cms they share and across how many segments. from the number of cms and segments, the relationship between the two individuals can be estimated; however, due to the random nature of dna inheritance, relationship estimates, especially for distant relatives, are only approximate. some more distant cousins will not match at all. although information about specific snps can be used for some purposes (e.g., suggesting likely eye color), the key information is the percentage of dna shared by two individuals. this can indicate the closeness of the relationship. however, it does not show the roles of the two individuals, e.g., % shared suggests a parent/child relationship, but it does not identify which individual is the parent.\\nvarious advanced techniques and analyses can be done on this data. this includes features such as in-common/shared matches, chromosome browsers, and triangulation. this analysis is often required if dna evidence is being used to prove or disprove a specific relationship.\\n\\n\\n=== x-chromosome dna testing ===\\nthe x-chromosome snp results are often included in autosomal dna tests.  both males and females receive an x-chromosome from their mother, but only females receive a second x-chromosome from their father. the x-chromosome has a special path of inheritance patterns and can be useful in significantly narrowing down possible ancestor lines compared to autosomal dna. for example, an x-chromosome match with a male can only have come from his maternal side. like autosomal dna, x-chromosome dna undergoes random recombination at each generation (except for father-to-daughter x-chromosomes, which are passed down unchanged). there are specialized inheritance charts which describe the possible patterns of x-chromosome dna inheritance for males and females.\\n\\n\\n=== strs ===\\nsome genealogical companies offer autosomal strs (short tandem repeats). these are similar to y-dna strs. the number of strs offered is limited, and results have been used for personal identification, paternity cases, and inter-population studies.law enforcement agencies in the us and europe use autosomal str data to identify criminals.\\n\\n\\n=== mitochondrial dna (mtdna) testing ===\\nthe mitochondrion is a component of a human cell, and contains its own dna. mitochondrial dna usually has , base pairs (the number can vary slightly depending on addition or deletion mutations) and is much smaller than the human genome dna which has . billion base pairs.  mitochondrial dna is transmitted from mother to child, as it is contained in the egg cell. thus, a direct maternal ancestor can be traced using mtdna. the transmission occurs with relatively rare mutations compared to autosomal dna. a perfect match found to another person\\'s mtdna test results indicates shared ancestry of possibly between  and  generations ago. more distant matching to a specific haplogroup or subclade may be linked to a common geographic origin.\\n\\n\\n==== test ====\\nthe mtdna, by current conventions, is divided into three regions. they are the coding region (-) and two hyper variable regions (hvr [-], and hvr [-]).the two most common mtdna tests are a sequence of hvr and hvr and a full sequence of the mitochondria. generally, testing only the hvrs has limited genealogical use so it is increasingly popular and accessible to have a full sequence. the full mtdna sequence is only offered by family tree dna among the major testing companies and is somewhat controversial because the coding region dna may reveal medical information about the test-taker\\n\\n\\n==== haplogroups ====\\n\\nall humans descend in the direct female line from mitochondrial eve, a female who lived probably around , years ago in africa. different branches of her descendants are different haplogroups. most mtdna results include a prediction or exact assertion of one\\'s mtdna haplogroup. mitochrondial haplogroups were greatly popularized by the book the seven daughters of eve, which explores mitochondrial dna.\\n\\n\\n==== understanding mtdna test results ====\\nit is not normal for test results to give a base-by-base list of results. instead, results are normally compared to the cambridge reference sequence (crs), which is the mitochondria of a european who was the first person to have their mtdna published in  (and revised in ). differences between the crs and testers are usually very few, thus it is more convenient than listing one\\'s raw results for each base pair.\\n\\nexamples\\nnote that in hvr, instead of reporting the base pair exactly, for example ,, the  is often removed to give in this example . the letters refer to one of the four bases (a, t, g, c) that make up dna.\\n\\n\\n=== y-chromosome (y-dna) testing ===\\nthe y-chromosome is one of the rd pair of human chromosomes. only males have a y-chromosome, because women have two x chromosomes in their rd pair. a man\\'s patrilineal ancestry, or male-line ancestry, can be traced using the dna on his y-chromosome (y-dna), because the y-chromosome is transmitted from a father to son nearly unchanged. a man\\'s test results are compared to another man\\'s results to determine the time frame in which the two individuals shared a most recent common ancestor, or mrca, in their direct patrilineal lines. if their test results are very close, they are related within a genealogically useful time frame. a surname project is where many individuals whose y-chromosomes match collaborate to find their common ancestry.\\nwomen who wish to determine their direct paternal dna ancestry can ask their father, brother, paternal uncle, paternal grandfather, or a paternal uncle\\'s son (their cousin) to take a test for them.\\nthere are two types of dna testing: strs and snps.\\n\\n\\n==== str markers ====\\nmost common is strs (short tandem repeat). a certain section of dna is examined for a pattern that repeats (e.g. atcg). the number of times it repeats is the value of the marker. typical tests test between  and  str markers. strs mutate fairly frequently. the results of two individuals are then compared to see if there is a match. dna companies will usually provide an estimate of how closely related two people are, in terms of generations or years, based on the difference between their results.\\n\\n\\n==== snp markers and haplogroups ====\\na person\\'s haplogroup can often be inferred from their str results, but can be proven only with a y-chromosome snp test (y-snp test).\\na single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) is a change to a single nucleotide in a dna sequence. typical y-dna snp tests test about , to , snps. getting a snp test allows a much higher resolution than strs. it can be used to provide additional information about the relationship between two individuals and to confirm haplogroups.\\nall human men descend in the paternal line from a single man dubbed y-chromosomal adam, who lived probably between , and , years ago. a \\'family tree\\' can be drawn showing how men today descend from him. different branches of this tree are different haplogroups. most haplogroups can be further subdivided multiple times into sub-clades. some known sub-clades were founded in the last  years, meaning their timeframe approaches the genealogical era (c. onwards).new sub-clades of haplogroups may be discovered when an individual tests, especially if they are non-european. most significant of these new discoveries was in  when the haplogroup a was discovered, which required theories about y-chromosomal adam to be significantly revised. the haplogroup was discovered when an african-american man tested strs at familytreedna and his results were found to be unusual. snp testing confirmed that he does not descend patrilineally from the \"old\" y-chromosomal adam and so a much older man became y-chromosomal adam.\\n\\n\\n=== using dna test results ===\\n\\n\\n==== ethnicity estimates ====\\nmany companies offer a percentage breakdown by ethnicity or region. generally the world is specified into about – regions, and the approximate percentage of dna inherited from each is stated. this is usually done by comparing the frequency of each autosomal dna marker tested to many population groups. the reliability of this type of test is dependent on comparative population size, the number of markers tested, the ancestry informative value of the snps tested, and the degree of admixture in the person tested. earlier ethnicity estimates were often wildly inaccurate, but as companies receive more samples over time, ethnicity estimates have become more accurate. testing companies such as ancestry.com will often regularly update their ethnicity estimates, which has caused some controversy from customers as their results update. usually the results at the continental level are accurate, but more specific assertions of the test may turn out to be incorrect.\\n\\n\\n== audience ==\\nthe interest in genealogical dna tests has been linked to both an increase in curiosity about traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins. those who test for traditional genealogy often utilize a combination of autosomal, mitochondrial, and y-chromosome tests. those with an interest in personal ethnic origins are more likely to use an autosomal test. however, answering specific questions about the ethnic origins of a particular lineage may be best suited to an mtdna test or a y-dna test.\\n\\n\\n=== maternal origin tests ===\\nfor recent genealogy, exact matching on the mtdna full sequence is used to confirm a common ancestor on the direct maternal line between two suspected relatives. because mtdna mutations are very rare, a nearly perfect match is not usually considered relevant to the most recent  to  generations. in cultures lacking matrilineal surnames to pass down, neither relative above is likely to have as many generations of ancestors in their matrilineal information table as in the above patrilineal or y-dna case: for further information on this difficulty in traditional genealogy, due to lack of matrilineal surnames (or matrinames), see matriname. however, the foundation of testing is still two suspected descendants of one person. this hypothesize and test dna pattern is the same one used for autosomal dna and y-dna.\\n\\n\\n=== tests for ethnicity and membership of other groups ===\\n\\nas discussed above, autosomal tests usually report the ethnic proportions of the individual. these attempt to measure an individual\\'s mixed geographic heritage by identifying particular markers, called ancestry informative markers or aim, that are associated with populations of specific geographical areas. geneticist adam rutherford has written that these tests \"don’t necessarily show your geographical origins in the past. they show with whom you have common ancestry today.\"the haplogroups determined by y-dna and mtdna tests are often unevenly geographically distributed. many direct-to-consumer dna tests described this association to infer the test-taker\\'s ancestral homeland. most tests describe haplogroups according to their most frequently associated continent (e.g., a \"european haplogroup\"). when leslie emery and collaborators performed a trial of mtdna haplogroups as a predictor of continental origin on individuals in the human genetic diversity panel (hgdp) and  genomes (kgp) datasets, they found that only  of  haplogroups had a success rate above % among the hgdp samples, as did \"about half\" of the haplogroups in the kgp. the authors concluded that, for most people, \"mtdna-haplogroup membership provides limited information about either continental ancestry or continental region of origin.\"\\n\\n\\n==== african ancestry ====\\ny-dna and mtdna testing may be able to determine with which peoples in present-day africa a person shares a direct line of part of his or her ancestry, but patterns of historic migration and historical events cloud the tracing of ancestral groups. due to joint long histories in the us, approximately % of african american males have a european y-chromosome haplogroup approximately % of african americans have at least the equivalent of one great-grandparent (%) of european ancestry. only about % have the equivalent of one great-grandparent of native american ancestry. by the early th century, substantial families of free persons of color had been established in the chesapeake bay area who were descended from free people during the colonial period; most of those have been documented as descended from white men and african women (servant, slave or free). over time various groups married more within mixed-race, black or white communities.according to authorities like salas, nearly three-quarters of the ancestors of african americans taken in slavery came from regions of west africa. the african-american movement to discover and identify with ancestral tribes has burgeoned since dna testing became available. african americans usually cannot easily trace their ancestry during the years of slavery through surname research, census and property records, and other traditional means. genealogical dna testing may provide a tie to regional african heritage.\\n\\n\\n==== united states – melungeon testing ====\\n\\nmelungeons are one of numerous multiracial groups in the united states with origins wrapped in myth. the historical research of paul heinegg has documented that many of the melungeon groups in the upper south were descended from mixed-race people who were free in colonial virginia and the result of unions between the europeans and africans. they moved to the frontiers of virginia, north carolina, kentucky and tennessee to gain some freedom from the racial barriers of the plantation areas. several efforts, including a number of ongoing studies, have examined the genetic makeup of families historically identified as melungeon. most results point primarily to a mixture of european and african, which is supported by historical documentation. some may have native american heritage as well. though some companies provide additional melungeon research materials with y-dna and mtdna tests, any test will allow comparisons with the results of current and past melungeon dna studies\\n\\n\\n==== native american ancestry ====\\n\\nthe pre-columbian indigenous people of the united states are called \"native americans\" in american english. autosomal testing, y-dna, and mtdna testing can be conducted to determine the ancestry of native americans. a mitochondrial haplogroup determination test based on mutations in hypervariable region  and  may establish whether a person\\'s direct female line belongs to one of the canonical native american haplogroups, a, b, c, d or x. the vast majority of native american individuals belong to one of the five identified mtdna haplogroups. thus, being in one of those groups provides evidence of potential native american descent. however, dna ethnicity results cannot be used as a substitute for legal documentation. native american tribes have their own requirements for membership, often based on at least one of a person\\'s ancestors having been included on tribal-specific native american censuses (or final rolls) prepared during treaty-making, relocation to reservations or apportionment of land in the late th century and early th century. one example is the dawes rolls.\\n\\n\\n==== cohanim ancestry ====\\n\\nthe cohanim (or kohanim) is a patrilineal priestly line of descent in judaism. according to the bible, the ancestor of the cohanim is aaron, brother of moses. many believe that descent from aaron is verifiable with a y-dna test: the first published study in genealogical y-chromosome dna testing found that a significant percentage of cohens had distinctively similar dna, rather more so than general jewish or middle eastern populations. these cohens tended to belong to haplogroup j, with y-str values clustered unusually closely around a haplotype known as the cohen modal haplotype (cmh). this could be consistent with a shared common ancestor, or with the hereditary priesthood having originally been founded from members of a single closely related clan.\\nnevertheless, the original studies tested only six y-str markers, which is considered a low-resolution test. in response to the low resolution of the original -marker cmh, the testing company ftdna released a -marker cmh signature that was more specific to the large closely related group of cohens in haplogroup j.\\na further academic study published in  examined more str markers and identified a more sharply defined snp haplogroup, je* (now jc, also called j-p*) for the j lineage. the research found \"that .% of kohanim carry y chromosomes belonging to a single paternal lineage (j-p*) that likely originated in the near east well before the dispersal of jewish groups in the diaspora. support for a near eastern origin of this lineage comes from its high frequency in our sample of bedouins, yemenis (%), and jordanians (%) and its precipitous drop in frequency as one moves away from saudi arabia and the near east (fig. ). moreover, there is a striking contrast between the relatively high frequency of j-* in jewish populations (»%) and kohanim (»%) and its vanishingly low frequency in our sample of non-jewish populations that hosted jewish diaspora communities outside of the near east.\"recent phylogenetic research for haplogroup j-m placed the \"y-chromosomal aaron\" in a subhaplogroup of j-l, l. (age estimate -ybp ybp): ysc>pf/cts>ysc>zs>zs>z (age estimate ybp).\\n\\n\\n==== european testing ====\\n\\n\\n== benefits ==\\n\\ngenealogical dna tests have become popular due to the ease of testing at home and their usefulness in supplementing genealogical research. genealogical dna tests allow for an individual to determine with high accuracy whether he or she is related to another person within a certain time frame, or with certainty that he or she is not related. dna tests are perceived as more scientific, conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records. however, they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied. the civil records are always only as accurate as the individuals having provided or written the information.\\ny-dna testing results are normally stated as probabilities: for example, with the same surname a perfect / marker test match gives a % likelihood of the most recent common ancestor (mrca) being within  generations, while a  of  marker match gives the same % likelihood of the mrca being within only  generations back.as presented above in mtdna testing, if a perfect match is found, the mtdna test results can be helpful. in some cases, research according to traditional genealogy methods encounters difficulties due to the lack of regularly recorded matrilineal surname information in many cultures (see matrilineal surname).autosomal dna combined with genealogical research has been used by adoptees to find their biological parents, has been used to find the name and family of unidentified bodies and by law enforcement agencies to apprehend criminals (for example, the contra costa county district attorney\\'s office used the \"open-source\" genetic genealogy site gedmatch to find relatives of the suspect in the golden state killer case.). the atlantic magazine commented in  that \"now, the floodgates are open. ..a small, volunteer-run website, gedmatch.com, has become ... the de facto dna and genealogy database for all of law enforcement.\" family tree dna announced in february  it was allowing the fbi to access its dna data for cases of murder and rape. however, in may  gedmatch initiated stricter rules for accessing their autosomal dna database and family tree dna shut down their y-dna database ysearch.org, making it more difficult for law enforcement agencies to solve cases.\\n\\n\\n== drawbacks ==\\ncommon concerns about genealogical dna testing are cost and privacy issues. some testing companies retain samples and results for their own use without a privacy agreement with subjects.autosomal dna tests can identify relationships but they can be misinterpreted. for example, transplants of stem cell or bone marrow will produce matches with the donor. in addition, identical twins (who have identical dna) can give unexpected results.testing of the y-dna lineage from father to son may reveal complications, due to unusual mutations, secret adoptions, and non-paternity events (i.e., that the perceived father in a generation is not the father indicated by written birth records). according to the ancestry and ancestry testing task force of the american society of human genetics, autosomal tests cannot detect \"large portions\" of dna from distant ancestors because it has not been inherited.with the increasing popularity of the use of dna tests for ethnicity tests, uncertainties and errors in ethnicity estimates are a drawback for genetic genealogy. while ethnicity estimates at the continental level should be accurate (with the possible exception of east asia and the americas), sub-continental estimates, especially in europe, are often inaccurate. customers may be misinformed about the uncertainties and errors of the estimates.some have recommended government or other regulation of ancestry testing to ensure its performance to an agreed standard.a number of law enforcement agencies took legal action to compel\\ngenetic genealogy companies to release genetic information that could match cold case crime victims or perpetrators. a number of companies fought the requests.\\n\\n\\n== medical information ==\\nthough genealogical dna tests are not designed mainly for medical purposes, autosomal dna tests can be used to analyze the probability of hundreds of heritable medical conditions, albeit the result is complex to understand and may confuse a non-expert.  andme provides medical and trait information from their genealogical dna test and for a fee the promethease web site analyses genealogical dna test data from family tree dna, andme, or ancestrydna for medical information. promethease, and its research paper crawling database snpedia, has received criticism for technical complexity and a poorly defined \"magnitude\" scale that causes misconceptions, confusion and panic among its users.the testing of full mtdna and ydna sequences is still somewhat controversial as it may reveal even more medical information. for example, a correlation exists between a lack of y-dna marker dys and infertility, and between mtdna haplogroup h and protection from sepsis. certain haplogroups have been linked to longevity in some population groups. the field of linkage disequilibrium, unequal association of genetic disorders with a certain mitochondrial lineage, is in its infancy, but those mitochondrial

genealogical dna test is a dnabased test used in genetic genealogy that looks at specific locations of a persons genome in order to find or verify ancestral genealogical relationships or with lower reliability to estimate the ethnic mixture of an individual since different testing companies use different ethnic reference groups and different matching algorithms ethnicity estimates for an individual vary between tests sometimes dramatically\\nthree principal types of genealogical dna tests are available with each looking at a different part of the genome and being useful for different types of genealogical research autosomal atdna mitochondrial mtdna and ydna\\nautosomal tests may result in a large number of dna matches to both males and females who have also tested with the same

traditional genealogical research and the sharing of family trees is typically required for interpretation of the results autosomal tests are also used in estimating ethnic mix\\nmtdna and ydna tests

transferred their test result for free to multiple testing sites and also to genealogical services such as genicom and gedmatch gedmatch said in  that about half of their one million profiles were from the usathe popular consciousness of dna testing and of dna generally is subject to a number of misconceptions involving the reliability of testing the nature of the connections with ones ancestors the connection between dna and personal traits etc\\n\\n\\n procedure \\n\\na genealogical dna test is performed on a dna sample obtained by cheekscraping also known as a buccal swab spitcups mouthwash or chewing gum  typically the sample collection uses a home test kit supplied by a service provider such as andme ancestrydna family tree dna or myheritage after following the kit instructions on how to collect the sample it is returned to the supplier for analysis the sample is then processed using a technology known as dna microarray to obtain the genetic information\\n\\n\\n types of tests \\nthere are three major types of genealogical dna tests autosomal which includes xdna ydna and mtdna\\n\\nautosomal dna tests look at chromosome pairs – and the x part of the rd chromosome the autosomes chromosome pairs – are inherited from both parents and all recent ancestors the xchromosome follows a special inheritance pattern because females xx inherit an xchromosome from each of their parents while males xy inherit an xchromosome from their mother and a ychromosome from their father xy ethnicity estimates are often included with this sort of testing\\nydna looks at the ychromosome which is passed down from father to son thus the ydna test can only be taken by males to explore their direct paternal line\\nmtdna looks at the mitochondria which is passed down from mother to child thus the mtdna test can be taken by both males and females and it explores ones direct maternal lineydna and mtdna cannot be used for ethnicity estimates but can be used to find ones haplogroup which is unevenly distributed geographically directtoconsumer dna test companies have often labeled haplogroups by continent or ethnicity eg an african haplogroup or a viking haplogroup but these labels may be speculative or misleading\\n\\n\\n autosomal dna atdna testing \\n\\n\\n testing \\nautosomal dna is contained in the  pairs of chromosomes not involved in determining a persons sex autosomal dna recombines in each generation and new offspring receive one set of chromosomes from each parent these are inherited exactly equally from both parents and roughly equally from grandparents to about x greatgrandparents therefore the number of markers one of two or more known variants in the genome at a particular location – known as singlenucleotide polymorphisms or snps inherited from a specific ancestor decreases by about half with each successive generation that is an individual receives half of their markers from each parent about a quarter of those markers from each grandparent about an eighth of those markers from each greatgrandparent etc inheritance is more random and unequal from more distant ancestors generally a genealogical dna test might test about  snps specific points in the genome\\n\\n\\n reporting process \\nthe preparation of a report on the dna in the sample proceeds in multiple stages\\n\\nidentification of the dna base pair at specific snp locations\\ncomparison with previously stored results\\ninterpretation of matches\\n\\n\\n base pair identification \\nall major service providers use equipment with chips supplied by illumina the chip determines which snp locations are tested different versions of the chip are used by different service providers in addition updated versions of the illumina chip may test different sets of snp locations the list of snp locations and base pairs at that location is usually available to the customer as raw data the raw data can sometimes be uploaded to another service provider to produce an additional interpretation and matches for additional analysis the data can also be uploaded to gedmatch a thirdparty web based set of tools that analyzes raw data from the main service providers\\n\\n\\n identification of matches \\nthe major component of an autosomal dna test is matching other individuals where the individual being tested has a number of consecutive snps in common with a previously tested individual in the companys database it can be inferred that they share a segment of dna at that part of their genomes if the segment is longer than a threshold amount set by the testing company then these two individuals are considered to be a match unlike the identification of base pairs the data bases against which the new sample is tested and the algorithms used to determine a match are proprietary and specific to each company\\nthe unit for segments of dna is the centimorgan cm for comparison a full human genome is about  cm the shorter the length of a match the greater are the chances that a match is spurious an important statistic for subsequent interpretation is the length of the shared dna or the percentage of the genome that is shared\\n\\n\\n interpretation of autosomal matches \\nmost companies will show the customers how many cms they share and across how many segments from the number of cms and segments the relationship between the two individuals can be estimated however due to the random nature of dna inheritance relationship estimates especially for distant relatives are only approximate some more distant cousins will not match at all although information about specific snps can be used for some purposes eg suggesting likely eye color the key information is the percentage of dna shared by two individuals this can indicate the closeness of the relationship however it does not show the roles of the two individuals eg  shared suggests a parentchild relationship but it does not identify which individual is the parent\\nvarious advanced techniques and analyses can be done on this data this includes features such as incommonshared matches chromosome browsers and triangulation this analysis is often required if dna evidence is being used to prove or disprove a specific relationship\\n\\n\\n xchromosome dna testing \\nthe xchromosome snp results are often included in autosomal dna tests  both males and females receive an xchromosome from their mother but only females receive a second xchromosome from their father the xchromosome has a special path of inheritance patterns and can be useful in significantly narrowing down possible ancestor lines compared to autosomal dna for example an xchromosome match with a male can only have come from his maternal side like autosomal dna xchromosome dna undergoes random recombination at each generation except for fathertodaughter xchromosomes which are passed down unchanged there are specialized inheritance charts which describe the possible patterns of xchromosome dna inheritance for males and females\\n\\n\\n strs \\nsome genealogical companies offer autosomal strs short tandem repeats these are similar to ydna strs the number of strs offered is limited and results have been used for personal identification paternity cases and interpopulation studieslaw enforcement agencies in the us and europe use autosomal str data to identify criminals\\n\\n\\n mitochondrial dna mtdna testing \\nthe mitochondrion is a component of a human cell and contains its own dna mitochondrial dna usually has  base pairs the number can vary slightly depending on addition or deletion mutations and is much smaller than the human genome dna which has  billion base pairs  mitochondrial dna is transmitted from mother to child as it is contained in the egg cell thus a direct maternal ancestor can be traced using mtdna the transmission occurs with relatively rare mutations compared to autosomal dna a perfect match found to another persons mtdna test results indicates shared ancestry of possibly between  and  generations ago more distant matching to a specific haplogroup or subclade may be linked to a common geographic origin\\n\\n\\n test \\nthe mtdna by current conventions is divided into three regions they are the coding region  and two hyper variable regions hvr  and hvr the two most common mtdna tests are a sequence of hvr and hvr and a full sequence of the mitochondria generally testing only the hvrs has limited genealogical use so it is increasingly popular and accessible to have a full sequence the full mtdna sequence is only offered by family tree dna among the major testing companies and is somewhat controversial because the coding region dna may reveal medical information about the testtaker\\n\\n\\n haplogroups \\n\\nall humans descend in the direct female line from mitochondrial eve a female who lived probably around  years ago in africa different branches of her descendants are different haplogroups most mtdna results include a prediction or exact assertion of ones mtdna haplogroup mitochrondial haplogroups were greatly popularized by the book the seven daughters of eve which explores mitochondrial dna\\n\\n\\n understanding mtdna test results \\nit is not normal for test results to give a basebybase list of results instead results are normally compared to the cambridge reference sequence crs which is the mitochondria of a european who was the first person to have their mtdna published in  and revised in  differences between the crs and testers are usually very few thus it is more convenient than listing ones raw results for each base pair\\n\\nexamples\\nnote that in hvr instead of reporting the base pair exactly for example  the  is often removed to give in this example  the letters refer to one of the four bases a t g c that make up dna\\n\\n\\n ychromosome ydna testing \\nthe ychromosome is one of the rd pair of human chromosomes only males have a ychromosome because women have two x chromosomes in their rd pair a mans patrilineal ancestry or maleline ancestry can be traced using the dna on his ychromosome ydna because the ychromosome is transmitted from a father to son nearly unchanged a mans test results are compared to another mans results to determine the time frame in which the two individuals shared a most recent common ancestor or mrca in their direct patrilineal lines if their test results are very close they are related within a genealogically useful time frame a surname project is where many individuals whose ychromosomes match collaborate to find their common ancestry\\nwomen who wish to determine their direct paternal dna ancestry can ask their father brother paternal uncle paternal grandfather or a paternal uncles son their cousin to take a test for them\\nthere are two types of dna testing strs and snps\\n\\n\\n str markers \\nmost common is strs short tandem repeat a certain section of dna is examined for a pattern that repeats eg atcg the number of times it repeats is the value of the marker typical tests test between  and  str markers strs mutate fairly frequently the results of two individuals are then compared to see if there is a match dna companies will usually provide an estimate of how closely related two people are in terms of generations or years based on the difference between their results\\n\\n\\n snp markers and haplogroups \\na persons haplogroup can often be inferred from their str results but can be proven only with a ychromosome snp test ysnp test\\na singlenucleotide polymorphism snp is a change to a single nucleotide in a dna sequence typical ydna snp tests test about  to  snps getting a snp test allows a much higher resolution than strs it can be used to provide additional information about the relationship between two individuals and to confirm haplogroups\\nall human men descend in the paternal line from a single man dubbed ychromosomal adam who lived probably between  and  years ago a family tree can be drawn showing how men today descend from him different branches of this tree are different haplogroups most haplogroups can be further subdivided multiple times into subclades some known subclades were founded in the last  years meaning their timeframe approaches the genealogical era c onwardsnew subclades of haplogroups may be discovered when an individual tests especially if they are noneuropean most significant of these new discoveries was in  when the haplogroup a was discovered which required theories about ychromosomal adam to be significantly revised the haplogroup was discovered when an africanamerican man tested strs at familytreedna and his results were found to be unusual snp testing confirmed that he does not descend patrilineally from the old ychromosomal adam and so a much older man became ychromosomal adam\\n\\n\\n using dna test results \\n\\n\\n ethnicity estimates \\nmany companies offer a percentage breakdown by ethnicity or region generally the world is specified into about – regions and the approximate percentage of dna inherited from each is stated this is usually done by comparing the frequency of each autosomal dna marker tested to many population groups the reliability of this type of test is dependent on comparative population size the number of markers tested the ancestry informative value of the snps tested and the degree of admixture in the person tested earlier ethnicity estimates were often wildly inaccurate but as companies receive more samples over time ethnicity estimates have become more accurate testing companies such as ancestrycom will often regularly update their ethnicity estimates which has caused some controversy from customers as their results update usually the results at the continental level are accurate but more specific assertions of the test may turn out to be incorrect\\n\\n\\n audience \\nthe interest in genealogical dna tests has been linked to both an increase in curiosity about traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins those who test for traditional genealogy often utilize a combination of autosomal mitochondrial and ychromosome tests those with an interest in personal ethnic origins are more likely to use an autosomal test however answering specific questions about the ethnic origins of a particular lineage may be best suited to an mtdna test or a ydna test\\n\\n\\n maternal origin tests \\nfor recent genealogy exact matching on the mtdna full sequence is used to confirm a common ancestor on the direct maternal line between two suspected relatives because mtdna mutations are very rare a nearly perfect match is not usually considered relevant to the most recent  to  generations in cultures lacking matrilineal surnames to pass down neither relative above is likely to have as many generations of ancestors in their matrilineal information table as in the above patrilineal or ydna case for further information on this difficulty in traditional genealogy due to lack of matrilineal surnames or matrinames see matriname however the foundation of testing is still two suspected descendants of one person this hypothesize and test dna pattern is the same one used for autosomal dna and ydna\\n\\n\\n tests for ethnicity and membership of other groups \\n\\nas discussed above autosomal tests usually report the ethnic proportions of the individual these attempt to measure an individuals mixed geographic heritage by identifying particular markers called ancestry informative markers or aim that are associated with populations of specific geographical areas geneticist adam rutherford has written that these tests don’t necessarily show your geographical origins in the past they show with whom you have common ancestry todaythe haplogroups determined by ydna and mtdna tests are often unevenly geographically distributed many directtoconsumer dna tests described this association to infer the testtakers ancestral homeland most tests describe haplogroups according to their most frequently associated continent eg a european haplogroup when leslie emery and collaborators performed a trial of mtdna haplogroups as a predictor of continental origin on individuals in the human genetic diversity panel hgdp and  genomes kgp datasets they found that only  of  haplogroups had a success rate above  among the hgdp samples as did about half of the haplogroups in the kgp the authors concluded that for most people mtdnahaplogroup membership provides limited information about either continental ancestry or continental region of origin\\n\\n\\n african ancestry \\nydna and mtdna testing may be able to determine with which peoples in presentday africa a person shares a direct line of part of his or her ancestry but patterns of historic migration and historical events cloud the tracing of ancestral groups due to joint long histories in the us approximately  of african american males have a european ychromosome haplogroup approximately  of african americans have at least the equivalent of one greatgrandparent  of european ancestry only about  have the equivalent of one greatgrandparent of native american ancestry by the early th century substantial families of free persons of color had been established in the chesapeake bay area who were descended from free people during the colonial period most of those have been documented as descended from white men and african women servant slave or free over time various groups married more within mixedrace black or white communitiesaccording to authorities like salas nearly threequarters of the ancestors of african americans taken in slavery came from regions of west africa the africanamerican movement to discover and identify with ancestral tribes has burgeoned since dna testing became available african americans usually cannot easily trace their ancestry during the years of slavery through surname research census and property records and other traditional means genealogical dna testing may provide a tie to regional african heritage\\n\\n\\n united states – melungeon testing \\n\\nmelungeons are one of numerous multiracial groups in the united states with origins wrapped in myth the historical research of paul heinegg has documented that many of the melungeon groups in the upper south were descended from mixedrace people who were free in colonial virginia and the result of unions between the europeans and africans they moved to the frontiers of virginia north carolina kentucky and tennessee to gain some freedom from the racial barriers of the plantation areas several efforts including a number of ongoing studies have examined the genetic makeup of families historically identified as melungeon most results point primarily to a mixture of european and african which is supported by historical documentation some may have native american heritage as well though some companies provide additional melungeon research materials with ydna and mtdna tests any test will allow comparisons with the results of current and past melungeon dna studies\\n\\n\\n native american ancestry \\n\\nthe precolumbian indigenous people of the united states are called native americans in american english autosomal testing ydna and mtdna testing can be conducted to determine the ancestry of native americans a mitochondrial haplogroup determination test based on mutations in hypervariable region  and  may establish whether a persons direct female line belongs to one of the canonical native american haplogroups a b c d or x the vast majority of native american individuals belong to one of the five identified mtdna haplogroups thus being in one of those groups provides evidence of potential native american descent however dna ethnicity results cannot be used as a substitute for legal documentation native american tribes have their own requirements for membership often based on at least one of a persons ancestors having been included on tribalspecific native american censuses or final rolls prepared during treatymaking relocation to reservations or apportionment of land in the late th century and early th century one example is the dawes rolls\\n\\n\\n cohanim ancestry \\n\\nthe cohanim or kohanim is a patrilineal priestly line of descent in judaism according to the bible the ancestor of the cohanim is aaron brother of moses many believe that descent from aaron is verifiable with a ydna test the first published study in genealogical ychromosome dna testing found that a significant percentage of cohens had distinctively similar dna rather more so than general jewish or middle eastern populations these cohens tended to belong to haplogroup j with ystr values clustered unusually closely around a haplotype known as the cohen modal haplotype cmh this could be consistent with a shared common ancestor or with the hereditary priesthood having originally been founded from members of a single closely related clan\\nnevertheless the original studies tested only six ystr markers which is considered a lowresolution test in response to the low resolution of the original marker cmh the testing company ftdna released a marker cmh signature that was more specific to the large closely related group of cohens in haplogroup j\\na further academic study published in  examined more str markers and identified a more sharply defined snp haplogroup je now jc also called jp for the j lineage the research found that  of kohanim carry y chromosomes belonging to a single paternal lineage jp that likely originated in the near east well before the dispersal of jewish groups in the diaspora support for a near eastern origin of this lineage comes from its high frequency in our sample of bedouins yemenis  and jordanians  and its precipitous drop in frequency as one moves away from saudi arabia and the near east fig  moreover there is a striking contrast between the relatively high frequency of j in jewish populations » and kohanim » and its vanishingly low frequency in our sample of nonjewish populations that hosted jewish diaspora communities outside of the near eastrecent phylogenetic research for haplogroup jm placed the ychromosomal aaron in a subhaplogroup of jl l age estimate ybp ybp yscpfctsysczszsz age estimate ybp\\n\\n\\n european testing \\n\\n\\n benefits \\n\\ngenealogical dna tests have become popular due to the ease of testing at home and their usefulness in supplementing genealogical research genealogical dna tests allow for an individual to determine with high accuracy whether he or she is related to another person within a certain time frame or with certainty that he or she is not related dna tests are perceived as more scientific conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records however they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied the civil records are always only as accurate as the individuals having provided or written the information\\nydna testing results are normally stated as probabilities for example with the same surname a perfect  marker test match gives a  likelihood of the most recent common ancestor mrca being within  generations while a  of  marker match gives the same  likelihood of the mrca being within only  generations backas presented above in mtdna testing if a perfect match is found the mtdna test results can be helpful in some cases research according to traditional genealogy methods encounters difficulties due to the lack of regularly recorded matrilineal surname information in many cultures see matrilineal surnameautosomal dna combined with genealogical research has been used by adoptees to find their biological parents has been used to find the name and family of unidentified bodies and by law enforcement agencies to apprehend criminals for example the contra costa county district attorneys office used the opensource genetic genealogy site gedmatch to find relatives of the suspect in the golden state killer case the atlantic magazine commented in  that now the floodgates are open a small volunteerrun website gedmatchcom has become  the de facto dna and genealogy database for all of law enforcement family tree dna announced in february  it was allowing the fbi to access its dna data for cases of murder and rape however in may  gedmatch initiated stricter rules for accessing their autosomal dna database and family tree dna shut down their ydna database ysearchorg making it more difficult for law enforcement agencies to solve cases\\n\\n\\n drawbacks \\ncommon concerns about genealogical dna testing are cost and privacy issues some testing companies retain samples and results for their own use without a privacy agreement with subjectsautosomal dna tests can identify relationships but they can be misinterpreted for example transplants of stem cell or bone marrow will produce matches with the donor in addition identical twins who have identical dna can give unexpected resultstesting of the ydna lineage from father to son may reveal complications due to unusual mutations secret adoptions and nonpaternity events ie that the perceived father in a generation is not the father indicated by written birth records according to the ancestry and ancestry testing task force of the american society of human genetics autosomal tests cannot detect large portions of dna from distant ancestors because it has not been inheritedwith the increasing popularity of the use of dna tests for ethnicity tests uncertainties and errors in ethnicity estimates are a drawback for genetic genealogy while ethnicity estimates at the continental level should be accurate with the possible exception of east asia and the americas subcontinental estimates especially in europe are often inaccurate customers may be misinformed about the uncertainties and errors of the estimatessome have recommended government or other regulation of ancestry testing to ensure its performance to an agreed standarda number of law enforcement agencies took legal action to compel\\ngenetic genealogy companies to release genetic information that could match cold case crime victims or perpetrators a number of companies fought the requests\\n\\n\\n medical information \\nthough genealogical dna tests are not designed mainly for medical purposes autosomal dna tests can be used to analyze the probability of hundreds of heritable medical conditions albeit the result is complex to understand and may confuse a nonexpert  andme provides medical and trait information from their genealogical dna test and for a fee the promethease web site analyses genealogical dna test data from family tree dna andme or ancestrydna for medical information promethease and its research paper crawling database snpedia has received criticism for technical complexity and a poorly defined magnitude scale that causes misconceptions confusion and panic among its usersthe testing of full mtdna and ydna sequences is still somewhat controversial as it may reveal even more medical information for example a correlation exists between a lack of ydna marker dys and infertility and between mtdna haplogroup h and protection from sepsis certain haplogroups have been linked to longevity in some population groups the field of linkage disequilibrium unequal association of genetic disorders with a certain mitochondrial lineage is in its infancy but those mitochondrial mutations that have been linked are searchable in the genome database mitomap family tree dnas mtfull sequence test analyses the full mtdna genome and the national human genome research institute operates the genetic and rare disease information center that can assist consumers in identifying an appropriate screening test and help locate a nearby medical center that offers such a test\\n\\n\\n dna in genealogy software \\nsome genealogy software programs – such as family

mouthwash or chewing gum  typically the sample collection uses a home test kit supplied by a service provider such as andme ancestrydna family tree dna or myheritage after following the kit instructions on how to collect the sample it is returned to the supplier for analysis the sample is then processed using a technology known as dna microarray to obtain the genetic information    types of tests  there are three major types of genealogical dna tests autosomal which includes xdna ydna and mtdna  autosomal dna tests look at chromosome pairs – and the x part of the rd chromosome the autosomes chromosome pairs – are inherited from both parents and all recent ancestors the xchromosome follows a special inheritance pattern because females xx inherit an xchromosome from each of their parents while males xy inherit an xchromosome from their mother and a ychromosome from their father xy ethnicity estimates are often included with this sort of testing ydna looks at the ychromosome which is passed down from father to son thus the ydna test can only be taken by males to explore their direct paternal line mtdna looks at the mitochondria which is passed down from mother to child thus the mtdna test can be taken by both males and females and it explores ones direct maternal lineydna and mtdna cannot be used for ethnicity estimates but can be used to find ones haplogroup which is unevenly distributed geographically directtoconsumer dna test companies have often labeled haplogroups by continent or ethnicity eg an african haplogroup or a viking haplogroup but these labels may be speculative or misleading    autosomal dna atdna testing     testing  autosomal dna is contained in the  pairs of chromosomes not involved in determining a persons sex autosomal dna recombines in each generation and new offspring receive one set of chromosomes from each parent these are inherited exactly equally from both parents and roughly equally from grandparents to about x greatgrandparents therefore the number of markers one of two or more known variants in the genome at a particular location – known as singlenucleotide polymorphisms or snps inherited from a specific ancestor decreases by about half with each successive generation that is an individual receives half of their markers from each parent about a quarter of those markers from each grandparent about an eighth of those markers from each greatgrandparent etc inheritance is more random and unequal from more distant ancestors generally a genealogical dna test might test about  snps specific points in the genome    reporting process  the preparation of a report on the dna in the sample proceeds in multiple stages  identification of the dna base pair at specific snp locations comparison with previously stored results interpretation of matches    base pair identification  all major service providers use equipment with chips supplied by illumina the chip determines which snp locations are tested different versions of the chip are used by different service providers in addition updated versions of the illumina chip may test different sets of snp locations the list of snp locations and base pairs at that location is usually available to the customer as raw data the raw data can sometimes be uploaded to another service provider to produce an additional interpretation and matches for additional analysis the data can also be uploaded to gedmatch a thirdparty web based set of tools that analyzes raw data from the main service providers    identification of matches  the major component of an autosomal dna test is matching other individuals where the individual being tested has a number of consecutive snps in common with a previously tested individual in the companys database it can be inferred that they share a segment of dna at that part of their genomes if the segment is longer than a threshold amount set by the testing company then these two individuals are considered to be a match unlike the identification of base pairs the data bases against which the new sample is tested and the algorithms used to determine a match are proprietary and specific to each company the unit for segments of dna is the centimorgan cm for comparison a full human genome is about  cm the shorter the length of a match the greater are the chances that a match is spurious an important statistic for subsequent interpretation is the length of the shared dna or the percentage of the genome that is shared    interpretation of autosomal matches  most companies will show the customers how many cms they share and across how many segments from the number of cms and segments the relationship between the two individuals can be estimated however due to the random nature of dna inheritance relationship estimates especially for distant relatives are only approximate some more distant cousins will not match at all although information about specific snps can be used for some purposes eg suggesting likely eye color the key information is the percentage of dna shared by two individuals this can indicate the closeness of the relationship however it does not show the roles of the two individuals eg  shared suggests a parentchild relationship but it does not identify which individual is the parent various advanced techniques and analyses can be done on this data this includes features such as incommonshared matches chromosome browsers and triangulation this analysis is often required if dna evidence is being used to prove or disprove a specific relationship    xchromosome dna testing  the xchromosome snp results are often included in autosomal dna tests  both males and females receive an xchromosome from their mother but only females receive a second xchromosome from their father the xchromosome has a special path of inheritance patterns and can be useful in significantly narrowing down possible ancestor lines compared to autosomal dna for example an xchromosome match with a male can only have come from his maternal side like autosomal dna xchromosome dna undergoes random recombination at each generation except for fathertodaughter xchromosomes which are passed down unchanged there are specialized inheritance charts which describe the possible patterns of xchromosome dna inheritance for males and females    strs  some genealogical companies offer autosomal strs short tandem repeats these are similar to ydna strs the number of strs offered is limited and results have been used for personal identification paternity cases and interpopulation studieslaw enforcement agencies in the us and europe use autosomal str data to identify criminals    mitochondrial dna mtdna testing  the mitochondrion is a component of a human cell and contains its own dna mitochondrial dna usually has  base pairs the number can vary slightly depending on addition or deletion mutations and is much smaller than the human genome dna which has  billion base pairs  mitochondrial dna is transmitted from mother to child as it is contained in the egg cell thus a direct maternal ancestor can be traced using mtdna the transmission occurs with relatively rare mutations compared to autosomal dna a perfect match found to another persons mtdna test results indicates shared ancestry of possibly between  and  generations ago more distant matching to a specific haplogroup or subclade may be linked to a common geographic origin    test  the mtdna by current conventions is divided into three regions they are the coding region  and two hyper variable regions hvr  and hvr the two most common mtdna tests are a sequence of hvr and hvr and a full sequence of the mitochondria generally testing only the hvrs has limited genealogical use so it is increasingly popular and accessible to have a full sequence the full mtdna sequence is only offered by family tree dna among the major testing companies and is somewhat controversial because the coding region dna may reveal medical information about the testtaker    haplogroups   all humans descend in the direct female line from mitochondrial eve a female who lived probably around  years ago in africa different branches of her descendants are different haplogroups most mtdna results include a prediction or exact assertion of ones mtdna haplogroup mitochrondial haplogroups were greatly popularized by the book the seven daughters of eve which explores mitochondrial dna    understanding mtdna test results  it is not normal for test results to give a basebybase list of results instead results are normally compared to the cambridge reference sequence crs which is the mitochondria of a european who was the first person to have their mtdna published in  and revised in  differences between the crs and testers are usually very few thus it is more convenient than listing ones raw results for each base pair  examples note that in hvr instead of reporting the base pair exactly for example  the  is often removed to give in this example  the letters refer to one of the four bases a t g c that make up dna    ychromosome ydna testing  the ychromosome is one of the rd pair of human chromosomes only males have a ychromosome because women have two x chromosomes in their rd pair a mans patrilineal ancestry or maleline ancestry can be traced using the dna on his ychromosome ydna because the ychromosome is transmitted from a father to son nearly unchanged a mans test results are compared to another mans results to determine the time frame in which the two individuals shared a most recent common ancestor or mrca in their direct patrilineal lines if their test results are very close they are related within a genealogically useful time frame a surname project is where many individuals whose ychromosomes match collaborate to find their common ancestry women who wish to determine their direct paternal dna ancestry can ask their father brother paternal uncle paternal grandfather or a paternal uncles son their cousin to take a test for them there are two types of dna testing strs and snps    str markers  most common is strs short tandem repeat a certain section of dna is examined for a pattern that repeats eg atcg the number of times it repeats is the value of the marker typical tests test between  and  str markers strs mutate fairly frequently the results of two individuals are then compared to see if there is a match dna companies will usually provide an estimate of how closely related two people are in terms of generations or years based on the difference between their results    snp markers and haplogroups  a persons haplogroup can often be inferred from their str results but can be proven only with a ychromosome snp test ysnp test a singlenucleotide polymorphism snp is a change to a single nucleotide in a dna sequence typical ydna snp tests test about  to  snps getting a snp test allows a much higher resolution than strs it can be used to provide additional information about the relationship between two individuals and to confirm haplogroups all human men descend in the paternal line from a single man dubbed ychromosomal adam who lived probably between  and  years ago a family tree can be drawn showing how men today descend from him different branches of this tree are different haplogroups most haplogroups can be further subdivided multiple times into subclades some known subclades were founded in the last  years meaning their timeframe approaches the genealogical era c onwardsnew subclades of haplogroups may be discovered when an individual tests especially if they are noneuropean most significant of these new discoveries was in  when the haplogroup a was discovered which required theories about ychromosomal adam to be significantly revised the haplogroup was discovered when an africanamerican man tested strs at familytreedna and his results were found to be unusual snp testing confirmed that he does not descend patrilineally from the old ychromosomal adam and so a much older man became ychromosomal adam    using dna test results     ethnicity estimates  many companies offer a percentage breakdown by ethnicity or region generally the world is specified into about – regions and the approximate percentage of dna inherited from each is stated this is usually done by comparing the frequency of each autosomal dna marker tested to many population groups the reliability of this type of test is dependent on comparative population size the number of markers tested the ancestry informative value of the snps tested and the degree of admixture in the person tested earlier ethnicity estimates were often wildly inaccurate but as companies receive more samples over time ethnicity estimates have become more accurate testing companies such as ancestrycom will often regularly update their ethnicity estimates which has caused some controversy from customers as their results update usually the results at the continental level are accurate but more specific assertions of the test may turn out to be incorrect    audience  the interest in genealogical dna tests has been linked to both an increase in curiosity about traditional genealogy and to more general personal origins those who test for traditional genealogy often utilize a combination of autosomal mitochondrial and ychromosome tests those with an interest in personal ethnic origins are more likely to use an autosomal test however answering specific questions about the ethnic origins of a particular lineage may be best suited to an mtdna test or a ydna test    maternal origin tests  for recent genealogy exact matching on the mtdna full sequence is used to confirm a common ancestor on the direct maternal line between two suspected relatives because mtdna mutations are very rare a nearly perfect match is not usually considered relevant to the most recent  to  generations in cultures lacking matrilineal surnames to pass down neither relative above is likely to have as many generations of ancestors in their matrilineal information table as in the above patrilineal or ydna case for further information on this difficulty in traditional genealogy due to lack of matrilineal surnames or matrinames see matriname however the foundation of testing is still two suspected descendants of one person this hypothesize and test dna pattern is the same one used for autosomal dna and ydna    tests for ethnicity and membership of other groups   as discussed above autosomal tests usually report the ethnic proportions of the individual these attempt to measure an individuals mixed geographic heritage by identifying particular markers called ancestry informative markers or aim that are associated with populations of specific geographical areas geneticist adam rutherford has written that these tests don’t necessarily show your geographical origins in the past they show with whom you have common ancestry todaythe haplogroups determined by ydna and mtdna tests are often unevenly geographically distributed many directtoconsumer dna tests described this association to infer the testtakers ancestral homeland most tests describe haplogroups according to their most frequently associated continent eg a european haplogroup when leslie emery and collaborators performed a trial of mtdna haplogroups as a predictor of continental origin on individuals in the human genetic diversity panel hgdp and  genomes kgp datasets they found that only  of  haplogroups had a success rate above  among the hgdp samples as did about half of the haplogroups in the kgp the authors concluded that for most people mtdnahaplogroup membership provides limited information about either continental ancestry or continental region of origin    african ancestry  ydna and mtdna testing may be able to determine with which peoples in presentday africa a person shares a direct line of part of his or her ancestry but patterns of historic migration and historical events cloud the tracing of ancestral groups due to joint long histories in the us approximately  of african american males have a european ychromosome haplogroup approximately  of african americans have at least the equivalent of one greatgrandparent  of european ancestry only about  have the equivalent of one greatgrandparent of native american ancestry by the early th century substantial families of free persons of color had been established in the chesapeake bay area who were descended from free people during the colonial period most of those have been documented as descended from white men and african women servant slave or free over time various groups married more within mixedrace black or white communitiesaccording to authorities like salas nearly threequarters of the ancestors of african americans taken in slavery came from regions of west africa the africanamerican movement to discover and identify with ancestral tribes has burgeoned since dna testing became available african americans usually cannot easily trace their ancestry during the years of slavery through surname research census and property records and other traditional means genealogical dna testing may provide a tie to regional african heritage    united states – melungeon testing   melungeons are one of numerous multiracial groups in the united states with origins wrapped in myth the historical research of paul heinegg has documented that many of the melungeon groups in the upper south were descended from mixedrace people who were free in colonial virginia and the result of unions between the europeans and africans they moved to the frontiers of virginia north carolina kentucky and tennessee to gain some freedom from the racial barriers of the plantation areas several efforts including a number of ongoing studies have examined the genetic makeup of families historically identified as melungeon most results point primarily to a mixture of european and african which is supported by historical documentation some may have native american heritage as well though some companies provide additional melungeon research materials with ydna and mtdna tests any test will allow comparisons with the results of current and past melungeon dna studies    native american ancestry   the precolumbian indigenous people of the united states are called native americans in american english autosomal testing ydna and mtdna testing can be conducted to determine the ancestry of native americans a mitochondrial haplogroup determination test based on mutations in hypervariable region  and  may establish whether a persons direct female line belongs to one of the canonical native american haplogroups a b c d or x the vast majority of native american individuals belong to one of the five identified mtdna haplogroups thus being in one of those groups provides evidence of potential native american descent however dna ethnicity results cannot be used as a substitute for legal documentation native american tribes have their own requirements for membership often based on at least one of a persons ancestors having been included on tribalspecific native american censuses or final rolls prepared during treatymaking relocation to reservations or apportionment of land in the late th century and early th century one example is the dawes rolls    cohanim ancestry   the cohanim or kohanim is a patrilineal priestly line of descent in judaism according to the bible the ancestor of the cohanim is aaron brother of moses many believe that descent from aaron is verifiable with a ydna test the first published study in genealogical ychromosome dna testing found that a significant percentage of cohens had distinctively similar dna rather more so than general jewish or middle eastern populations these cohens tended to belong to haplogroup j with ystr values clustered unusually closely around a haplotype known as the cohen modal haplotype cmh this could be consistent with a shared common ancestor or with the hereditary priesthood having originally been founded from members of a single closely related clan nevertheless the original studies tested only six ystr markers which is considered a lowresolution test in response to the low resolution of the original marker cmh the testing company ftdna released a marker cmh signature that was more specific to the large closely related group of cohens in haplogroup j a further academic study published in  examined more str markers and identified a more sharply defined snp haplogroup je now jc also called jp for the j lineage the research found that  of kohanim carry y chromosomes belonging to a single paternal lineage jp that likely originated in the near east well before the dispersal of jewish groups in the diaspora support for a near eastern origin of this lineage comes from its high frequency in our sample of bedouins yemenis  and jordanians  and its precipitous drop in frequency as one moves away from saudi arabia and the near east fig  moreover there is a striking contrast between the relatively high frequency of j in jewish populations » and kohanim » and its vanishingly low frequency in our sample of nonjewish populations that hosted jewish diaspora communities outside of the near eastrecent phylogenetic research for haplogroup jm placed the ychromosomal aaron in a subhaplogroup of jl l age estimate ybp ybp yscpfctsysczszsz age estimate ybp    european testing     benefits   genealogical dna tests have become popular due to the ease of testing at home and their usefulness in supplementing genealogical research genealogical dna tests allow for an individual to determine with high accuracy whether he or she is related to another person within a certain time frame or with certainty that he or she is not related dna tests are perceived as more scientific conclusive and expeditious than searching the civil records however they are limited by restrictions on lines that may be studied the civil records are always only as accurate as the individuals having provided or written the information ydna testing results are normally stated as probabilities for example with the same surname a perfect  marker test match gives a  likelihood of the most recent common ancestor mrca being within  generations while a  of  marker match gives the same  likelihood of the mrca being within only  generations backas presented above in mtdna testing if a perfect match is found the mtdna test results can be helpful in some cases research according to traditional genealogy methods encounters difficulties due to the lack of regularly recorded matrilineal surname information in many cultures see matrilineal surnameautosomal dna combined with genealogical research has been used by adoptees to find their biological parents has been used to find the name and family of unidentified bodies and by law enforcement agencies to apprehend criminals for example the contra costa county district attorneys office used the opensource genetic genealogy site gedmatch to find relatives of the suspect in the golden state killer case the atlantic magazine commented in  that now the floodgates are open a small volunteerrun website gedmatchcom has become  the de facto dna and genealogy database for all of law enforcement family tree dna announced in february  it was allowing the fbi to access its dna data for cases of murder and rape however in may  gedmatch initiated stricter rules for accessing their autosomal dna database and family tree dna shut down their ydna database ysearchorg making it more difficult for law enforcement agencies to solve cases    drawbacks  common concerns about genealogical dna testing are cost and privacy issues some testing companies retain samples and results for their own use without a privacy agreement with subjectsautosomal dna tests can identify relationships but they can be misinterpreted for example transplants of stem cell or bone marrow will produce matches with the donor in addition identical twins who have identical dna can give unexpected resultstesting of the ydna lineage from father to son may reveal complications due to unusual mutations secret adoptions and nonpaternity events ie that the perceived father in a generation is not the father indicated by written birth records according to the ancestry and ancestry testing task force of the american society of human genetics autosomal tests cannot detect large portions of dna from distant ancestors because it has not been inheritedwith the increasing popularity of the use of dna tests for ethnicity tests uncertainties and errors in ethnicity estimates are a drawback for genetic genealogy while ethnicity estimates at the continental level should be accurate with the possible exception of east asia and the americas subcontinental estimates especially in europe are often inaccurate customers may be misinformed about the uncertainties and errors of the estimatessome have recommended government or other regulation of ancestry testing to ensure its performance to an agreed standarda number of law enforcement agencies took legal action to compel genetic genealogy companies to release genetic information that could match cold case crime victims or perpetrators a number of companies fought the requests    medical information  though genealogical dna tests are not designed mainly for medical purposes autosomal dna tests can be used to analyze the probability of hundreds of heritable medical conditions albeit the result is complex to understand and may confuse a nonexpert  andme provides medical and trait information from their genealogical dna test and for a fee the promethease web site analyses genealogical dna test data from family tree dna andme or ancestrydna for medical information promethease and its research paper crawling database snpedia has received criticism for technical complexity and a poorly defined magnitude scale that causes misconceptions confusion and panic among its usersthe testing of full mtdna and ydna sequences is still somewhat controversial as it may reveal even more medical information for example a correlation exists between a lack of ydna marker dys and infertility and between mtdna haplogroup h and protection from sepsis certain haplogroups have been linked to longevity in some population groups the field of linkage disequilibrium unequal association of genetic disorders with a certain mitochondrial lineage is in its infancy but those mitochondrial mutations that have been linked are searchable in the genome database mitomap family tree dnas mtfull sequence test analyses the full mtdna genome and the national human genome research institute operates the genetic and rare disease information center that can assist consumers in identifying an appropriate screening test and help locate a nearby medical center that offers such a test    dna in genealogy software  some genealogy software programs – such as family tree maker legacy family tree deluxe edition and the swedish program genney – allow recording dna marker test results this allows for tracking of both ychromosome and mtdna tests and recording results for relatives    see also     references     further reading     external
