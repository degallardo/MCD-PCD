0,"I had the Samsung A600 for awhile which is absolute doo doo. You can read my review on it and detect my rage at the stupid thing. It finally died on me so I used this Nokia phone I bought in a garage sale for $1. I wonder y she sold it so cheap?... Bad: ===> I hate the menu. It takes forever to get to what you want because you have to scroll endlessly. Usually phones have numbered categories so u can simply press the # and get where you want to go. ===> It's a pain to put it on silent or vibrate. If you're in class and it rings, you have to turn it off immediately. There's no fast way to silence the damn thing. Always remember to put it on silent! I learned that the hard way. ===> It's so true about the case. It's a mission to get off and will break ur nails in the process. Also, you'll damage the case each time u try. For some reason the phone started giving me problems once I did succeed in opening it. ===> Buttons could be a bit bigger. Vibration could be stronger. Good: ===> Reception is not too shabby. I was using it in the elevator which is a remarkable feat considering my old phone would lose service by simply putting it in my pocket. ===> Compared to my old Samsung, this phone works quite well. The ring tones are loud enough to hear and the phone actually charges quickly and has great battery life. It doesn't heat up like a potatoe in the oven either during long phone convos. ===> Nice bright, large screen. ===> Cute ways to customize it.

1,"Due to a software issue between Nokia and Sprint this phone's text messaging capabilities don't work with Sprint's system and won't until a software patch comes out ""some time in the next few months"". You will have to spend at least 1 hour with Sprint's award winning customer service team to find someone who will admit this to you. The problem is that Nokia designed their phones so that incoming messages are retrieved quickly and then viewed ""offline"" the way most providers work. Sprint, however, likes to have people hook up to their server first and then stay connected, burning minutes while they check their inbox, compose a reply and wait for the Sprint server to respond so they can send it out.

2,"This is a great, reliable phone. I also purchased this phone after my samsung A460 died. The menu is easily comprehendable and speed dialing is available for around 300 numbers. Voice dialing is also a nice feature, but it takes longer than speed dialing. The only thing that bothers me is the games...Nokia seems to have taken snake (1 and 2) off their phones. There is a skydiving game, bowling, and tennis (like pong). The ringers are very nice, and a feature is available to choose a different ringer for each person calling. However, ringtones are not available online to download to this phone. You're pretty much stuck with what you have. There are vibrating ringtones and regular (midi) polyphonic tones.

10,"I've had this phone for over a year and I really like it. Having never been partial to flip phones, I can appreciate this Nokia's features. The color screen is very nice and all of the features are easy to use. The keylock is a simple two-button sequence though I do wish it had a timer for the keylock like my old phone. It has a lot of useful features, like a calculator, organizer, stopwatch and alarm, but the three games it has are too lame to play. The customizable features are nice, but lacking in variety. This isn't the ideal phone for a guy. You're few options are pretty girly. The ringtones also lack something to be desired, but there are a few decent ones. The battery life is pretty good, nothing special, but definitely not bad. It gets me through the average day without problems and sometimes lasts for several days. My parents, sisters, and husband all got fancy Samsung flip phones with cameras and all the toys, and I must say mine works better. The battery lasts MUCH longer and the recpetion is MUCH better. The downside to this cute phone is the case. It's made of very weak plastic that cracked in a few months. Also, if you're thinking about getting a different case for it, DON'T! Once you take it off, it will keep slipping off. It never attaches firmly again, and neither does the new case you bought. I've read this in other reviews too. Because of this, the last time I dropped it the back piece popped off and the battery flew out. Now my phone has issues. Drat. Overall, it's a great phone, if you're content with the simpler things in life. Who really uses the camera on thier phone anyway?

11,"1.) Slow - If you want to check your missed calls list, this phone feels compelled to inform you whether or not there are any new calls in the list...it does this for about 20 seconds. Of course, it will take you half a second to read the message...and you probably don't care about what it says. 2.) Annoying - Ever had anyone scream in your ear? That's a sensation I get from this phone on a regular basis. It has the nice ability to attach a voice tag to a phone number...a useful feature...when it works. About 80% of the time, it recognizes the number I ask for, the other 20% it lets me know that it doesn't understand...by screeching (next to my head). Want to know what that feels like with your phone? Turn the ringer up to the highest setting, hold the phone next to your ear, call your phone. Not pleasant. Add to this the fact that when you're searching one of the numerous menus on the phone (menus that have at least 5 items in them), the menu system uses up a whole screen to display one line of text. It has three lines available to it...but it uses one. What's next? What did you just pass? Go back and look, can't find out another way! 3.) Fragile - My phone is cracked. Why you ask? Because I took off the battery cover. Why did you take off the battery cover you ask? Because I wanted to write this review and that was the only way to find out the model number. 4.) Heavy - Speaks for itself...the phone weighs way too much. 5.) Bulky - Again, like heavy, speaks for itself. My recommendation: buy a better phone.

12,"I bought this phone about a year ago and have been using it ever since, on the Sprint PCS network, to replace an old TP2100. The first time I bought it, the phone was defective, so I had to get it replaced after a few days. I liked the phone okay at first, but I really wish I can go back in time and buy a better phone. Several issues: *mediocre reception. *rather bulky and unattractive. *cheap feel, cheaply made, cheap materials. *screen not easily visible in bright sunlight. *battery life marginal. I will go into a little detail about a few things. I get okay reception on this phone. It is NOT GOOD reception. The phone will work in areas where there is a good signal, but in areas with a marginal signal, such as my apartment, the phone will drop calls left and right, and fade in and out about 5 seconds of every minute (this is outside, so interference from the building is not the cause). In my residence, I use my husband's Sanyo, as it gets an excellent signal, and doesn't drop nearly as many calls. I have had Sprint check out the phone, and they say it is working correctly. I can only assume it is the poor quality of the phone that is to blame. The phone is quite big for what I would expect from a modern phone, with no camera. In a small purse, it takes up a lot of room. What is more important is that the phone is cheaply made, and has a cheap feel to it. It's made out of rather flimsy plastic. I dropped the phone once onto concrete from about 3 feet up, and the antenna head got a crack in it and a corner of the phone got serious scratches. Also, the screen can be difficult to read in bright sunlight, but it's quite bright otherwise. As far as battery life goes, it's not that great. I've gone to bed with the battery half full and have woken up to a dead phone. I believe the poor reception in my immediate area is to blame, as the phone searches for a signal and that takes battery time. Talk time is decent. Pros: *LOUD ringer *lots of features, but I rarely use them.",  buy phone year ago use ever since Sprint PCS network replace old TP first time buy phone defective get replace day like phone okay first really wish go back time buy good phone Several issue mediocre reception rather bulky unattractive cheap feel cheaply make cheap material screen easily visible bright sunlight battery life marginal go little detail thing get okay reception phone GOOD reception phone work area good signal area marginal signal apartment phone drop call leave right fade second every minute outside interference building cause residence use husband Sanyo get excellent signal drop nearly many call Sprint check phone say work correctly assume poor quality phone blame phone quite big would expect modern phone camera small purse take lot room important phone cheaply make cheap feel make rather flimsy plastic drop phone onto concrete foot antenna head get crack corner phone get serious scratch Also screen difficult read bright sunlight quite bright otherwise far battery life go great go bed battery half full wake dead phone believe poor reception immediate area blame phone search signal take battery time Talk time decent Pros LOUD ringer lot feature rarely use,0.22382305194805197,Positive,0.8526,Positive,Positive
13,This is an excellent choice for Sprint to use when enrolling new customers for service. It is the free option for most new customers and it has been excellent after a year of ownership. I love how it lights up when someone is calling which helps to really find the phone quickly when you are in the dark. If you have the phone in a purse it really makes it easy to find due to this fact. The Nokia phone seems to be tougher to me than the Samsung phones at the Sprint store also. So my only issue with the phone is the fact that since it is not a flip phone the keypad must be locked before I drop the phone in my pants pocket. This can be annoying if you get used to owning a flip phone before moving to the Nokia.,  excellent choice Sprint use enrol new customer service free option new customer excellent year ownership love light someone call help really find phone quickly dark phone purse really make easy find due fact Nokia phone seem tough Samsung phone Sprint store also issue phone fact since flip phone keypad must lock drop phone pant pocket annoy get use own flip phone move Nokia,0.31015512265512263,Positive,0.9458,Positive,Positive

19,"My problems with nextel did not stop when I canceled my service. I will get to the problems with the service. When I went to get a new phone a day before my contract expired, I of course wanted to keep my number. So as I went to get my Cingular phone (highly recommended), I had the old number switched to my new number. Today, I get in the mail my nextel statement for the month with a $200 early termination even though I had not canceled my service, but had simply got a new phone and switched my number over. This was on icing on the cake after 2 years of absolutely amazingy bad service from nextel. In my town, not a small town by any means, there are very few places that have any service. In the largest subdivision, you cannot get service anywhere. I constantly get comments from people trying to reach me that get the classic nextel line...Please hold while the nextel subscriber you are trying to reach is located. Most of the time I would not even recieve incoming calls, calls would go straight to my voice mail. Not only would I not get the calls, but often I would not even get the voice mails until days or even weeks later. When I did actually take calls (and call out), I cannot count the number of times I've had my call dropped. I recieved so many different error messages sometimes I wonder if they just spend all their time at nextel thinking of different error messages to program into their phones. That brings me to the selling point of nextel, the famed and well-loved direct connect feature. This is an absolute joke. Direct connect only works MAYBE half the time I tried to use it. Even then, in the middle of the conversation I would be greeted by the loud beep of my phone telling me I wont be talking to that person anymore. Of course, I would expect nothing less from the nextel network. Text messaging with nextel is next to impossible. If it did not take hours to send or recieve a message, it took days, or maybe didn't even come at all. The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked. Of course, when you don't have service, you don't get the internet access either. I was constantly getting the message ""network not available"". Calling and trying to complain to nextel is futile. Trying to get through to customer service takes forever and once you get through they do nothing. My experience with nextel has been nothing short of a disaster and I write this trying to warn anyone considering nextel. Stick with Verizon or Cingular and you will be much happier in the end.

I hoped it might last 6 months, until I decided what to do next (change service providers, get a new contract with a free phone, etc.) To my surprise, this little brick of a phone just keeps going. It has not been treated lightly (I recently opened up the back to find the serial #, and found it full of dirt & dust). It has crashed with me skiing, been splashed with salt water while sailing, and been drenched in sweat while in my bike jersey. Still, it works. Complaints: I dearly wish it had a camera, even a crappy one. Sometimes the exposed buttons get pressed accidentally. It has no fancy features. But I'm going to buy another one-- just in case this one ever quits. UPDATE 1/1/12: This phone is still going. 5+ years now. I bought this phone when the first-generation iPhone came out.

I have never tried soaking it in water, but I have dropped it, thrown it, scraped it, kicked it etc. and the screen and battery are still perfectly functional. Great battery life as well. My battery has NEVER run out on me. EVER! And I am super-negligent when it comes to charging it. Of course, the phone really only has normal calling and basic texting.

39,"I've been using this phone for about three weeks, now, and it truly is a nice little phone. It's small, light, and the keypad and screen really light up...you can actually see the screen in very bright sunlight! It does everything I want a phone to do. The graphics on the web are really very good, although accessing the web is rather slow. The keypad IS quite small, and this could be a problem for most men, but it's perfect for me. The only negative is that it doesn't have speaker phone capability. The battery life is, as the others have said, amazing! As for the person whose wife's phone was dead, it probably was jostled in her purse and was inadvertently turned on. I prefer bar phones to any other kind (not sure why), and one of the first things I learned was to lock the keypad whenever I put it in my purse, in my pocket, or any other place where it would be possible for the phone to be accidentally turned on. It's a simple matter of pushing two keys to turn on the lock or to shut it off, and sure saves a lot of battery life.",  use phone three week truly nice little phone small light keypad screen really light actually see screen bright sunlight everything want phone graphic web really good although access web rather slow keypad quite small could problem men perfect negative speaker phone capability battery life others say amazing person whose wife phone dead probably jostle purse inadvertently turn prefer bar phone kind sure one first thing learn lock keypad whenever put purse pocket place would possible phone accidentally turn simple matter push two key turn lock shut sure save lot battery life,0.21647727272727274,Positive,0.9479,Positive,Positive
40,"Well, my phone that came with my service plan is.. well.. its now a paper weight (darn razrs!!) I didnt want to spend another 100+ on a phone that wil just break, then i stumbled upon these gophones, they are from 19.99-99.99 at best buy and work perfectly with my AT&T monthly subscription SIM card, so its just a crazy cheap phone. The battery life is AMAZING, its rated 9 hours, when i first bought it i opened it in the store and turned it on, it had 1 bar. It wasnt for another 3 hours untill i got home to charge it, and it still had the same 1 bar of battery life. I also talked a good 25 minutes too. VERY durable, i love the battery back, its not one of those slide ones (like some Sony phones), and its not one where you just push a button (like the RAZR). its a combination, you press the butten and then slide, it works REALLY WELL so there is very little chance you will break/lose the cover. came preloaded with 3 games for me, this cool space invader style game, a soccer game, and this weird mole game that is my personal favorite. Came with a TON of actually decent tones you can set as your ringtone.. unlike the RAZR which came with a horrid selection. it also came with an unactivated brand new sim card. so if your like me and you just bought this phone so you can put your old sim card into it, you will get a bonus sim card that you can sell on craigslist for like 10-15 dollars, seeing that it came with one of the new 3G cards. my only real complaint is that the keypad is really cramped, but its still easily usable, but you still get the feeling that its cramped, and my phone only came with 3 preloaded images to set as my wallpaper, and at times the call quality is a little shakey, but it rarely happens and when it does it goes away very fast... but for 30 dollars! thats a fraction of a price than the cheapest upgrade service plan phone. ---- I really doubt anybody will actually read this edit, but it is definitely worth a mention. I have had this phone since august (its Feb. 11). I hope dropped it countless times, this phone WILL NOT BREAK. Seriously, I've tried. I take horible care of this phone. I wanted to test its durability (and show off to my friends that my 20 dollar phone is more durable than your 5,000,000,000 dollar one) As demonstrations I've thrown it at trees, walls, concrete sidewalk, I've thrown it in the snow... hell I've even tossed it on the concrete and invited my friends to join me in a game of soccer with it. No joke. I didn't just do this once, but several, several times. The worst that has happened to it is the battery-cover snapped off and the battery fell out, all I had to do was put the battery back in, snap on the cover and turn the phone on. After about 4 months of treating it like that I did the same thing, actually just today (Feb. 11th). I chucked it at the concrete ground, the battery/battery cover flew off (as usual) but to my surprise when I turned it on I had a small black bar through the screen, but even more surprising is that it still works perfectly, everything does. It amazes me how poorly I've taken care of this phone, if I had done even 1/16th of the things I did to this phone to my old RAZR I can assure you it would have snapped in half or something. I highly recommend this phone.

41,"I got this phone based on a recommendation from AT&T :( silly me. I wanted a back up phone my wife could use in case her other phone failed to turn on (also a motorola different model almost 5x price). They recommend this phone because of it's low cost and it's a go phone so you only pay for minutes you use. I bought the phone and loved it. It was very low cost, came with airtime. It feels very solid, except for the battery cover which seems flimsy but seems to hold up with no problems. It had what I felt as good sound quality and a good number of features for such a low cost phone. I wanted to prep the battery since my wife was going to travel soon, so I left it powered on and would constantly press a button so the light would stay on and drain the battery. The display is amazingly bright, I could almost use it as a flashlight. I was also really surprised at the battery life. Anyhow after two cycles of draining the battery and then charging it to full, I figured it would be all set to use as an emergency phone for my wife who was going on a two week business trip. Wrong :( on the last day of her trip her main cell phone battery was low so she decided to try to use the back up phone. It wouldn't turn on :( I don't know if it was due to the xray machines at the airports or what but the battery was drained. She said she never turned it on at all until that day so maybe it got turned on accidently in her purse (phone turns on by pressing a button on the front for 4 or 5 seconds). Anyhow to make matters worse the AT&T rep also said I could also use it as a main phone by transfering the SIM. Nope didn't work either, I was on the older AT&T plan so I had to be migrated. Atleast the phone didn't cost too much. I figure I can still keep it as an emergency 911 phone too (Go phone minutes expire :( which the AT&T rep didn't tell me about).

It also made a few other death - defying leaps. It is VERY drop resistant. That being said, it is not crush proof. It's battery was just about dead so I decided to leave it in the car to charge. I plugged it into the car charger, grabbed my purse, and got out of the car. Unbeknownst to me, the charger cord was tangled around my purse. I stood up and closed the car door - right on this phone. That left a BIG mark - that finally did it in (If it still worked, I would have had the world's first boomerang phone - it looked just like a boomerang afterwards). I just ordered a new one. As much as I beat up my last phone and as well as it fared, I had to get another one.

The sound quality on both the built in speaker and mic and the speaker phone are very good, the phone itself is very portable and it has buttons one does not have to be a midget to operate. On the negative side (and why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars), it has a relatively small battery for its size, as anyone who has opened but back to install can attest. Hence the battery power for such a basic phone is not on a par with other ""basic"" phones, though not by much. A second critique is the very small screen which is, in addition, not very well lit. It can be a problem viewing, even in the shade. A third problem is that the interface for some of the features (i.e., voice recorder, contact list) is not as easy as it should be. Thanks to the small screen, one needs to scroll quite a bit to access some of the phone's features. One last critique is that the messaging service is quite slow.

55,"I am a professional who recently purchased a Sanyo Juno phone to use as an extra special-purpose business phone. After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan.

The US Nokia manual says the Microusb port is for ""authorized personal only"", which to my mind says that the carriers in the US wanted to force people into getting things onto the phone via some $$$-chargeable method.

78,"I needed a replacement phone, and did not want to sign up for a new contract, so I bought a Nokia 1680c at the full retail price. This phone is a good value. It rings loud & clear, and the speakerphone is easy to hear. People I'm calling say my voice is clear, though they can tell I'm on a cell phone. It has a lot of neat software features; for example, you can configure a shortcut action for the left and right softkeys, as well the Up-Down-Left-Right buttons. There is no dedicated rocker switch on the side for volume up & down; during a call, the volume is adjusted by the Left and Right buttons. The phone is constructed well, but feels too light. Battery life is very good. The screen is bright and clear. Navigating menus can be a little sluggish. The keypad is stiff, making text messaging a chore. No Bluetooth connectivity, so forget about using one of those fancy headsets. The box does include a wired earbud/microphone with integrated call answer/end button. Something that annoyed me was how it saved numbers to the address book from an incoming call; the Nokia software puts a ""+"" symbol in front of incoming call numbers. That gets saved to the address book -- for example ""+15551212121"" -- a minor thing, and something probably more useful for European phone numbers, for example.

I tried, the car dealer tried and while NO issues are reported with this phone and its blue tooth capabilities I beg to differ! I read another review of a person who had exact same trouble with a different model car and was also told the phone is fine. It is obviously something unique to this model only because other samsung phones pair without problems. I got my phone exchanged and after going through that it still will not pair with my car. I wanted this phone because it is simpler than the previous envy 2 I owned but even that phone will pair with my car. I plan to switch to a smart phone as soon as the Nexus One comes to verizon.

81,"Just recently got this phone as a replacement to my i760 and am happy to be back to a flip phone. Great Camera, have not tested video yet. Battery life is solid. I'll give samsung credit for the rotating/changable keyboard, a cool thing for the next model might be a customizable keyboard where you have the ability to assign values to each key. As far as ease of use for the keyboard...I havent had any problems and I have large hands/fingers. It takes a little getting used to but once acclimated you should have no problems. I cant comment on voice recognition or blue tooth as I dont really use those features and honestly find them useless (once in a while I'll use my ear piece in the car but its rare). I also dont plan on using it as an MP3 player...I have an ipod for that. If your looking for a phone to synch with outlook then find one where that is offered in the specs. Yes you can remotely sync and get access to web email but nowhere in the description is outlook mentioned so I cant hold that against the phone. It would be like faulting my car cause it doesnt fly (I know thats an exageration but its kinda the same thing) when its clearly not meant for that. If you need a phone that syncs with outlook then get a pda phone. This is basically your standard flip with a few extra features and probly wont be as popular with the mickey mouse club kids that want an iPhone like device that they can watch movies on and giggle over the txts their friends just sent. Interface is about the same as any other VZ flip phone I've had in the past.

82,"Good overall phone, bluetooth so far syncs well with the integrated bluetooth in a Mercedes that I used to have and also with the aftermarket Alpine stereo that I have in my VW. But some of the features and design are just poor and/or not thought out. Looks great but the body is far too slippery. It's like handling a bar of soap. I use it as my primary alarm clock in the morning and it's really clumsy to grab off the nightstand and shut off the alarm. Even when I'm fully awake and alert :-) it's hard to open and I've dropped it a few times while fumbling to open it. There is a wider slit on the clamshell lid to fit your finger into when opening in portrait mode but in landscape mode there's no place to insert your finger to flip it open, so you have to use your fingernail. Unlike my previous phone, it takes two hands almost all the time to open this thing whereas my old phone I could easily flip it open with one hand. I wish the alarm clock's snooze function was like most clock radios where it allows 10 minutes snooze time, not 5. 5 is just too short. Or, the phone should allow you to set the snooze period as a preference. There is no way to display the time on the front screen when the phone is dark; you have to open it up. Well, you can fake it by holding the lock button for the music keys, which will light up the display) but then you have to hold it a second time to reset the lock/unlock back to where you had it. Also, when you're on a call (although just about every cell phone fails on this) the clock doesn't display anywhere (so this is no better than other phones). How many times have you been on a call and said ""Hey let's meet later!"" and the person asks you ""Ok, what time is it now?"" and you can't tell. (I quit wearing watches because of the clocks on cell phones...but why don't they display the time when on a call?) The keys on the outside aren't too bad except the volume up/down is a little too easy to accidentally press. I like the keyboard idea overall but I find it's like typing on little Chiclet gum candies. I need to use my fingernails to avoid fat-fingering it. In QWERTY mode, the END button is too close to the space bar and I have inadvertantly killed my web browser when typing a space in a field on a page. Frustrating! With the END key was farther away. Wish they would have also engineered in some page up/down keys too, as scrolling line by line is cumbersome. I would also like the END and SEND keys to somehow be the traditional red and green colors too. I use Outlook on my netbook to ""sync"" (sort of) my contacts to the phone. This works alright but if you want to refresh your contacts you have to delete them all from the phone and then resend them over or they'll be duplicates. This is a bit annoying only in that you will then need to re-enter the ICE contacts manually. The bluetooth can send pics to my netbook, but only one at a time (cumbersome). Can't select multiple photos at once. Won't send videos at all to my netbook via Bluetooth. Have to send them via a picture message to email and fake it that way but you incur data usage charges doing it that way. Or you can use removable storage on the MicroSD card to do it. The biggest disappointment is the calendar. What a useless piece of junk! It says you can send calendar appointments to the phone, which you can, but it is half-baked. If you set a reminder in Outlook, the reminder doesn't carry over to the phone. The phone only supports one text field for the appointment and it corresponds to the Outlook appointment body (not the header meeting description nor location), so I have to retype the description and location in the Outlook calendar body if I want to see anything useful on the phone. Even then, some appointments come over with an empty text field on the phone (it is either a problem with the text being too long and/or having a carriage return in the text I think). So if I try to then enter it on the phone (enter the description in the displayed (and empty) text field), the phone freezes and then reboots. Terrible! The recurring meeting also is miserably half-baked. You cannot set an interval like ""every other week"". I work a 9/80 work schedule and I want to have every other Friday that I work in my phone so I know when I'm off work or not. I can only choose daily, weekly, monthly, or annually. So while it does take Outlook calendar items, they end up so flawed and useless that if you really do plan on using this phone as an organizer, don't; it will fail to meet your needs. I understand that Samsung uses this same calendar in many of its products and if so, it will be a deal breaker next time around for me and I'll shop a different brand. The add-on Mobile Email from OZ isn't too bad but it also has room for improvement. It is billed as ""fully integrated"" but not in my eyes. While the phone itself has a limited file viewer for certain file types stored on it, if you receive an email with attachments (even if just a .jpg), the OZ mobile email doesn't support accessing attachments. This is not what I call ""fully integrated"". The OZ email client also works a bit inconsistently (although maybe it's an issue with the email providers and not OZ?). With my Cox POP3 accounts, I can only access the inbox (not sent items). With Yahoo and Hotmail, I can access the various folders OK. With my university's email account (hosted by Google GMAIL), it displays both the inbox and the sent items in the inbox (really weird, and I imagine if I had other folders it might lump everything togeter as well). The user interface for the OZ mobile email isn't too bad although it was a bit unintuitive to find how to add a recipient to an email from the phone's contacts. Can be done but just was hard to find. Also isn't clear on how to add multiple recipients (use a comma or semicolon between them? don't know...) Beware of Verizon's compusory data plan with this phone. It is misleading. Supposedly for $9.99 a month you get 25MB of data usage. This often isn't presented clearly. It applies only to the web browser. Texting and picture messaging are not part of this 25MB **even though they use a data connection!**. It should be called a ""web browsing plan"", not a ""data plan"". So unless you pay for an additional texting plan, you will be charged for each message. I was pretty furious when my first bill arrived to find I was charged for the picture messages I sent thinking it was part of my ""data plan"". The mp3 player is alright although once or twice it froze up on me and I had to restart the phone. The headphone jack is a nontypical 2.5mm so you will need an adapter to go to 3.5mm. Booooo. Battery life is so-so. If at work I listen to mp3s during the day and also do a little lunchtime web browsing for about 10-15 minutes, I can easily go from a full battery to dead in about 5-6 hours. I don't know if this is typical or not of most phones, but it'd be nice if the mp3s can make it through one whole workday, but it can't.

83,"I loved my Samsung Alias, as most Alias owners do. I decided to purchase the Alias 2 on faith, assuming that Samsung had simply updated certain features of the original. I was mistaken. The first thing you will notice is the size; the alias 2 is taller, thicker, and wider than the original. If you are like me, one of the reasons you bought the original alias was it's super-slim design. I would say it's about 50% bulkier than the original. While the original slid into your jeans and disappeared, the new one will stick out like a sore thumb. I suppose the increase in size supports the new and improved camera/camcorder but I never used that feature too much in the first place. Ultimately, I would say this is the reason I returned the alias 2, but I also did not care for the much ballyhooed liquid ink screen. When texting, you must toggle through 3 screens to find all the numbers/symbols/punctuation marks that you need. In fact, the third screen only had a scant number of symbols on it, so the empty space is frustrating when toggling to the first screen for the letters. The empty space is a theme on all screens in fact, in either orientation. As I said, I found this annoying (maybe only because I became so used to the 1000 figures/symbols crammed onto the original alias phone pad). I ended up returning the alias 2 and going back to the original.

84,"I've gone through several phones in the last few years - whenever my rebates would apply I would upgrade. Last year I settled on the Alias 2, mostly because of the e-ink technology. I was impressed at first but the excitement of the new phone wore off as it always does. Regardless, it remains a trustworthy phone. Hopefully Samsung's newer versions of the Alias will fix a few flaws that I've run into, not the least of which is a slow system. When you're in the middle of typing a text and a new text comes in, the phone freezes momentarily before saving the text-in-progress in a draft and showing you the new text. The fact that the phone saves the text is good - but it would be better if the incoming text flew to the background and the phone allowed you to continue your typing. I've had to learn that when I'm typing a text and the phone stops registering what I'm trying to enter, I have to stop pushing buttons. If you give it a second, it'll resume normal running - otherwise, you might accidentally delete the incoming text. The same goes for trying to take a picture while a text comes in - except the picture doesn't save. Occasionally the phone gets confused - if you flip from landscape to vertical positions too fast, the keys and screen don't change, even after you push a few buttons. It continues to operate as if it were in vertical mode, even though the phone is flipped to the normal position. I like that I can switch from vertical to horizontal and back while in the middle of a text, but this only works if you flip fast enough (there's plenty of time - plus if you close the phone and don't flip fast enough, it simply saves your draft) and doesn't apply to any application other than an in-progress text. There's a decent signal with the Alias 2 - my previous phone was a cheap-o so I noticed an improvement in the signal but I can't verify that it's better than the enV or Omnia or other higher-end phone. If you're considering this phone, take into consideration that none of the cases, including the slimmest clear plastic ones, fit very well on the dual-hinge. They don't prevent the phone from opening, but they do cause a strain on the hinge when flipped in landscape mode and they make phone bulkier than necessary. In terms of size, it has a great feel. It's probably a little bit taller than most phones (about the size of the enV Touch and the orignal enV) but it's very slim and definitely pocket-sized. The keyboard, both in landscape and vertical modes, is a great size and perfect for texting. The keys have a unique feel and are not too big and not too small. The front display provides access to your music and taking a picture self-portrait style. (I've seen some complaints that this isn't possible - it is, you have to hold down the play/pause button then the skip-back button to activate the camera. You can see a preview of the picture and simply press the play/pause button again to take the pic.) The front display also allows you to see text message previews and a quick response with the ""Quick texts"" ... You have to have ""Auto-display text"" options set - a feature I didn't discover until I'd had the phone for six or seven months. (Probably should have read the manual!) The volume for the speaker and the mic are good - I haven't had trouble with not being able to hear anyone or with them hearing me. The speaker phone can be a bit crackly if it's up all the way, but full volume is not necessary as it is plenty loud. When the phone is closed, i.e. listening to music - it needs to be up a bit louder and therefore is sometimes crackly but I'm satifisied with it. After all, it's phone, not a iPod dock. All-in-all, this is a great phone with just a few minor problems. I'm still happy with it after the initial novelty has worn off, even though I'm lusting after an enV Touch (just my personal fickleness when it comes to phones!)

87,"I've had this phone for a couple of months. It's pretty cool in the way the screen and keypad can be used in either portrait or landscape. However, the keys don't have good tactile feedback. I have to type with my fingernail in order to press the keys hard enough and accurately. Its voice recognition software is worthless, so if you are accustomed to using this feature to dial (such as in the car using an earpiece), don't bother.

94,"Pros: Creative use of buttons, big screen, qwerty keyboard Cons: Doesn't sync with Outlook, clunky user interface, muddled audio in ear piece/speakerphone I really have to give credit to Samsung because of the creatively designed keypad, but I don't recommend this phone overall. The phone user interface isn't simple, and is made somewhat more complicated because they keyboard layout is constantly changing based on what screen you're on. For example, there's an awkward key layout in some versions of the layout, takes too many keystrokes to do things like turn off an alarm (I guess I've been spoiled by almost always owning Nokias, as they tend to have the best-designed user interfaces). Aside from the clumsy UI, the biggest thing that killed this for our family was its inability to sync contacts and calendar events with Outlook. Maybe there's a way to do it with a combination of MyVerizon and USB cables, but its not worth the effort, especially when I can switch to a Nokia that takes care of it (as an aside, I switched to AT&T a week later because of the poor phone selection at Verizon. Also, Verizon disables any Bluetooth syncing capabilities with Outlook, even for the few Nokias they offer.) Overall, the phone is designed creatively, but its hip design doesn't make up for its poor UI and lack of features that were essential to me.",  Pros Creative use button big screen qwerty keyboard Cons sync Outlook clunky user interface muddle audio ear piece speakerphone really give credit Samsung creatively design keypad recommend phone overall phone user interface simple make somewhat complicated keyboard layout constantly change base screen example awkward key layout version layout take many keystroke thing like turn alarm guess spoil almost always own Nokias tend best design user interface Aside clumsy UI big thing kill family inability sync contact calendar event Outlook Maybe way combination MyVerizon USB cable worth effort especially switch Nokia take care aside switch week later poor phone selection Verizon Also Verizon disable Bluetooth syncing capability Outlook even Nokias offer Overall phone design creatively hip design make poor UI lack feature essential,0.04583333333333334,Positive,0.6344,Positive,Negative

100,"The first time I heard about the Samsung Alias I thought I was in for a unique phone/messaging experience. After all, it contains the E Ink powered keyboard technology where keys can transform from vertical to horizontal and from regular to QWERTY keyboard at the touch of a button and using the dual-flip style that makes this phone more than just the typical flip phone. The first release had its faults, which is why Samsung and Verizon have released the Alias 2. The phone has its improvements. The best one is the fact that, when flipped open sideways, you get enough room to navigate and type with the QWERTY keyboard. The keys are not as crammed in together as the first Alias, for more comfortable typing. The phone also contains GPS, VCast Music with Rhapsody, web e-mail , IM capabilities and a mobile web browser. You can use these features with Verizon's fast EV-DO/3 G network. The phone also has a user-friendly menu and beautiful internal and external display. It's got 80 MB of internal memory (memory expandable to 16 GB with a media card) and a 2 MP camera with some nice, though limited video-recording capabilities. The Alias 2, though an improvement from the original Alias, has its downsides. For one thing, it looks outdated. At a mere glance, it looks like a typical flip phone that's been out for years. It only comes in one color (grayish black), and there's nothing about it that makes it attractive or unique at first glance. The keys are difficult to press. I had to press the keys rather hard every time I used the QWERTY keyboard. My thumbs ached after a while. The OS is quirky. It froze on me quite a few times and I had to do a force reboot. Very annoying when you're in the middle of sending a text message or checking your e-mail. And that's another thing, the calling, or lack thereof. I had about three dropped calls in one day. That's a lot for a phone, especially when I had most if not all network bars. What gives? And last but not least, the phone contains the same old Verizon menu and looks. The only nice thing about it is that you can personalize the internal and external screens with some cute animated wallpaper or other. All in all, the Samsung Alias 2 has all the makings for a popular messaging/multimedia phone. However, I don't think it's quite ready for prime time yet. A slicker design would be nice as well as some improved features and smoother keys. If you're in the bargain for a messaging phone that's stylish as well as functional, and you're in the Verizon network, I strongly recommend the LG enV3 or the enV Touch. You cannot go wrong with those two phones. In the meantime, if you really want this phone, make sure you weigh in the pros and cons before you decide to commit to it for two long years.",  first time hear Samsung Alias think unique phone message experience contain E Ink power keyboard technology key transform vertical horizontal regular QWERTY keyboard touch button use dual flip style make phone typical flip phone first release fault Samsung Verizon release Alias phone improvement best one fact flip open sideways get enough room navigate type QWERTY keyboard key cram together first Alias comfortable type phone also contain GPS VCast Music Rhapsody web e mail IM capability mobile web browser use feature Verizon fast EV G network phone also user friendly menu beautiful internal external display get MB internal memory memory expandable GB medium card MP camera nice though limited video record capability Alias though improvement original Alias downside one thing look outdated mere glance look like typical flip phone year come one color grayish black nothing make attractive unique first glance key difficult press press key rather hard every time use QWERTY keyboard thumb ache OS quirky freeze quite time force reboot annoy middle send text message check e mail another thing call lack thereof three drop call one day lot phone especially network bar give last least phone contain old Verizon menu look nice thing personalize internal external screen cute animate wallpaper Samsung Alias making popular messaging multimedia phone However think quite ready prime time yet slicker design would nice well improved feature smooth key bargain messaging phone stylish well functional Verizon network strongly recommend LG enV enV Touch go wrong two phone meantime really want phone make sure weigh pro con decide commit two long year,0.1484950584007188,Positive,0.9881,Positive,Positive
101,"Let me preface this review with a disclaimer: I am NOT a techie nor a tycoon who needs continual internet access lest the global market crash. I need a basic phone, and want a few bells and whistles. I replaced a basic LG cell phone with the Alias2 on the recommendation of a friend. I immediately liked the heftier feel and the easier to read displays, though I swiftly changed the rather twee and hard to figure out menu page. Pros: I LOVE having dedicated keys for voicemail, bluetooth and voice menus. The rotating keypad is just too cool for words, and though I don't send many texts, I use the notepad all the time. The QWERTY keyboard is very easy to use, even with fingernails. It's nice to know I can check email and have internet access if necessary, though I probably never will. The camera is great, and I like the editing options for pictures. The screen size is generous and easy to see, especially in landscape mode. It's easy to use. Sound quality is good. Nice long life of battery charge. Cons: The default backgrounds, though those are easy enough to change. Some functions are difficult to find on the menus. That's how I found the voicemail key--couldn't find VM on a menu. The ring isn't loud enough to be heard when the phone is in a jacket pocket--but I've never found a phone with a loud enough ring. There's not a button on the outside that will light up the display--to check the time, you have to open the phone. (ETA: Yes, there is--it just takes a few seconds for the display to light. Duh.)

104,"As a teenager, I do a lot of texting. This phone has a great full QWERTY keyboard or if you want, a number pad. The changing keys are cool and people go ooo! and ahh! as they see you flip it both ways. The 2 megapixel camera is good for recording video and photos. There is only a small piece holding the screen to the bottom unit in the corner that seems flimsy from the pictures. It is NOT a flimsy device. This was not a problem. In fact, while walking home on a trail I dropped it without realizing it. The next day I was looking for it all over. When I was walking on the trail I noticed it in the mud. I was mortified because people drive ATV/Quads all over the trail. Upon lifting up the phone I saw that it had been run over and caked in mud. I knew it was not going to work because of how wet it was. Amazingly, it worked fine. I got home and brushed it with a paper towel. It's as good as new. The only problem is that you have to change the keyboard layout in order to get to the numbers. This makes it just as hard to type the number 4 as it is to type four.

It's incredibly frustrating. I don't want to look at my phone as I am driving, that is why I rely on the Voice Activation/Bluetooth to make my calls.

145,"These are great phones. My wife's old one had a broken screen, so I replaced this and my son's non RAZR phone. We had good experience with the RAZR, so we decided to get 2 this time. I ""upgraded"" both phones online without any issues. We have an old Verizon plan, didn't want to pay the required data plan for a new smart phone, and didn't like their current non-smart phones. I'm guessing that Verizon intentional had some bad non-smart phones so people would lean towards the more profitable smart phones and plans. We only use our phones for calls, so this was a great alternative to getting a Verizon store offered phone. I am a long time Verizon customer, but would have switched to another provider than pay for an unnecessary data plan if I had to. I am happy I can keep my old plan, and not have to switch to their newer plans. Note that Verizon customer support did not volunteer this upgrade option (buying replacement phone from non-Verizon store) until I asked them directly. I also could not get my GetItNow or BackupAssitant (contact auto-sync) to work on these legacy/unsupported Verizon phones. Not a show stopper for me since I printed (but wasted too much paper--wished they had a simple list view) the contacts that were already in the contacts online from my old, broken phone, and just manually copy/backup the numbers now. Also we (wife and I) don't use GetItNow (much). Too bad since I thought BackupAssistant was one of Verizon's better, more useful features, especially when upgrading phones. It was (and still is) annoying that they didn't upgrade their error messge when trying to run GetItNow/Get_New_App from ""Unable to retrieve catalog. Please try again later. (3332)"" to ""Legacy/unsupported phone. Don't waste your time to try again"". If I didn't see the reviews for this error, I think I would have wasted my time with Verizon support since I didn't see any positive feedback (good/simple solutions) yet. If they wanted to fix the issue, they would of had a good, simple resolution a few years ago, not just possibly getting support at a Verizion store, and possibly getting an unusable phone at the end. Again, my online ""upgrade/replacement"" of my phone was simple and straigtforward, and my phone calls are working fine. I wouldn't think Verison would make much money from supporting or if they still sold these old/legacy phones, so fixing/maintaining their sofware for them would be a very low priority (they wouldn't want say they give no support to their existing phones). At the end, I am still happy I could keep my old (non-data) plan, fix/replace my phone, even though I don't have BackupAssitant. Phone and phone call quality is still 5 stars.

I was excited when I got this in the mail and the phone looked like official Verizon merchandise but I later learned that not all features were supported by the Verizon network even though this phone is advertised by the seller that it does. The first thing I noticed when I turned the phone on was that the software was different than my old one but I figured the phone may have older/newer software. I went to the Verizon store and they had a little trouble getting the phone activated but once it was up then it was ready to go but only a couple things...it constantly roams and it can not send nor recieve picture messages. I was on the phone with Verizon's tech support for over two hours but they were not able to help me so their suggestion was to go to a Verizon store. So, back to the Verizon store I went where I was told the software that was installed was through Altell...not Verizon. They said they would not be able to flash it to Verizon so that I could actually utilize all the features of the phone without frying the phone. I went to another Verizon store who did attempt to flash it but it did nothing. As the representative looked at the phone she noticed that the back plate which this seller boasted as a Verizon phone was just a little off which indicated that the Verizon back plate was not the original and there were some scuff marks on it...which also indicated that the phone was used..another disappointment since the one I ordered was advertised as new. I paid close to 80.00 for this phone because the seller indicated that it was indeed a Verizon phone and was supported by the Verizon network. $80.00 lesson learned and now I have a phone that I can't use except as a great paper weight and a powerful reminder there isn't always truth in advertising.",  purchase phone hope replace old razr Verizon excite get mail phone look like official Verizon merchandise later learn feature support Verizon network even though phone advertise seller first thing notice turn phone software different old one figure phone may old new software go Verizon store little trouble get phone activate ready go couple thing constantly roam send recieve picture message phone Verizon tech support two hour able help suggestion go Verizon store back Verizon store go tell software instal Altell Verizon say would able flash Verizon could actually utilize feature phone without fry phone go another Verizon store attempt flash nothing representative look phone notice back plate seller boast Verizon phone little indicate Verizon back plate original scuff mark also indicate phone use another disappointment since one order advertise new pay close phone seller indicate indeed Verizon phone support Verizon network lesson learn phone use except great paper weight powerful reminder always truth advertising,0.1009881422924901,Positive,0.9756,Positive,Positive

238,"I'll first say what others have said on similar reviews--this is a review of the actual phone, not the seller or the carrier service. What can I say? This was my very first phone, and man was it a good one. I still have one as my backup phone. Even to this day, it is one of the most reliable products I have ever owned, and is far more reliable than almost every phone on the market today (rivaled only by the iPhone). The phone could hardly be any thinner and fits easily in any pocket. Its hinge is strong and durable; I never had it break or cease to function. The paint never chipped (except when I dropped it) or lost its color. The software (mine was Verizon software) is nothing special, but it does its job very well. It is easily navigable, making it simple to check text messages or phone records. It's not made for extended web sessions, but you can check your email on it just fine. The camera isn't the highest resolution out there, but it works as intended when you need a picture in a pinch. The keys feel great and are big enough for anyone to see. They can easily be texted on. The keypad on my RAZR did finally fall apart over time, but it lasted well over 2 years before doing so and the buttons still worked in spite of it. I'm rating this phone 5 stars because it accomplished what it set out to do; give the user a quality, reliable, and innovative (for its time) product that blasted the competition out of the water. It isn't for everyone; it has none of the smartphone ""flair"" or performance, but it gets the job of a phone and text message platform done extremely well. This phone was born in a world without smartphones, but even today in a world where smartphones dominate, the Motorola RAZR V3 hasn't lost its relevance or effectiveness--and I respect that a great deal.",  first say others say similar review review actual phone seller carrier service say first phone man good one still one backup phone Even day one reliable product ever own far reliable almost every phone market today rival iPhone phone could hardly thinner fit easily pocket hinge strong durable never break cease function paint never chip except drop lose color software mine Verizon software nothing special job well easily navigable make simple check text message phone record make extended web session check email fine camera high resolution work intend need picture pinch key feel great big enough anyone see easily texted keypad RAZR finally fall apart time last well year button still work spite rating phone star accomplish set give user quality reliable innovative time product blast competition water everyone none smartphone flair performance get job phone text message platform do extremely well phone bear world without smartphones even today world smartphones dominate Motorola RAZR V lose relevance effectiveness respect great deal,0.2557875457875458,Positive,0.9753,Positive,Positive

It came with a charger and a battery. The charger was aftermarket, and the connector was of very low quality - it broke within a week or so. Because Motorola back in the day tried to force you to use ""genuine"" chargers, I had to get a Motorola charger. Then the batter stopped holding a charge a week or so after that. I believe there was a guarantee, but we had to go on a trip and didn't have time to wait - so I grossly overpaid for a batter at batteries plus. Things were going ok, but eventually the 0 button stopped working reliably a few months later, then the phone starting locking up a month or so after than.

263,"The phone that I received was rated as being in ""very good"" condition yet the entire Get It Now/Media Store function refused to work. This is a problem that Verizon Wireless is aware of and has no plans to do anything about it. Details can be found in my review here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CD4BYNT4DA46/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm (I'm not allowed to duplicate my own reviews.. even if it is for the same problem on essentially the same product). If downloads are important to you, beware because many older Verizon phones just can't do it anymore.. and the sellers don't seem to know anything about it. I sent four requests to four different sellers requesting information as to whether their phone's Get It Now/Media Store was removed and didn't get a single reply. I emailed the seller that I bought mine from, I was told that the phone was ""completely functional"" in spite of the fact that it was missing the Get It Now/Media Store (functionality that is contained in the description of the product). I was offered a refund but couldn't find a seller that would tell me if their phone worked or not.. so what's the point. Thanks a lot Verizon for breaking so many phones and thanks to the sellers that don't even know that the equipment they are selling doesn't work correctly (my seller didn't even have a Verizon account to test his phones with!). If you only make and receive calls and texts, this probably doesn't apply to you.

331,"Through no fault of the resellers (and unbeknownst to most of them), many of the older Verizon phones MAY have their Get It Now/Media Store rendered unusable. This takes away the ability to download music, ringtones, videos and ANY applications (such as Backup Assistant, VZ Navigator, games, weather, maps, etc.) from Verizon. Back in late March, 2011, Verizon pushed an update to all their phones and any of the older phones that were not activated at the time lost the Get It Now/Media Store catalog with no way to retrieve it through future updates. Verizon will tell you that you can take it to a store to get it flashed to restore the Get It Now/Media Center catalog, but it seems that basically none of the stores have the ability to actually flash phones (there was a report of a store in South Carolina that could flash phones..). More information (including official input from Verizon employees) can be found on Verizon's support community forum site (search for ""Error Cannot retrieve catalog... (3328) Backup Asst..""). If you only use your phone to make calls and/or text, this information does not apply to you. If you DO use Get It Now/Media Store, you will probably want to check with the seller to make sure that the phone's Get It Now/Media Store works.. or you might end up with a Get It Not.

I have a kayak and wanted to be able to take a phone out on the boat without worry about water getting in it. I also purchased a Verizon belt clip with holder that wraps around the phone. Well this first thing I found was that the belt clip kept coming off my belt and the phone kept landing on hard floors, etc. The second thing I know the outside screen (thin plastic) is cracked. Verizon wants a minimum of $189 to replace it with a used phone (unless I'd purchased insurance). Phone repair places can't get parts to repair it. Of course this eliminates the waterproofing feature, since water can likely get in the 2 cracks on the screen. I don't mind the cracks themselves since I don't really use the outside screen. Third happening was when the holder that wraps around the phone started coming off and letting the phone fall out. That's when I discarded the belt clip/holder and started carrying the phone in my pocket. I've decided I was actually better off with the old phone. I'd have had a lot more dollars in my pocket, since the Mil spec designation adds NOTHING! Other than that it's a pretty good phone.

I have read other reviewers say that Verizon would not/could not activate their phone on the prepaid network. I'm not sure what's going on but I'm pretty irritated. I like the phone, alot for the use I've gotten out of it so far (very little), but the whole reason I ditched my smartphone was because I was sick of all the complicated BS. P.S. If anyone could help me figure out what's going on here I'd appreciate it. EDIT: Apparently me and Verizon were both being idiots. I have it active and working as it should now. The phone itself is wonderful. Since I still have a data plan I can get all kinds of cute little arcade games and apps. Simple things of course but I'm a simple lady. It's a pretty sturdy phone, it's lightweight and feels like it might be made of cheap material but it's designed in a way to take a fall. One reason smartphones break so easily is because they are square and flat. This thing is rounded on any angle. The 'closed' screen is flat but it is slightly inlayed in the phone so if you do drop it directly on that surface it will hit the plastic edges of the phone and not the screen. The backplate isn't sealing as tightly as it should, which probably does not make it waterproof ""up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes"" but I think that might have been my fault by trying to improperly open the backplate. The keypad is silicone or something and has no gaps. With the backplate properly sealed I'm sure it is waterproof. Christmas came early lol I'm happy with this little guy.

It is VERY simple and it STILL gets great reception compared to other verizon phones I've had. I still wouldn't call it rugged at all. But, for a penny- I think it is the best bet of all the 1 cent options, as it is still working great after 6 months and the fact that it weighs nothing and doesn't seem to contain any glass or metal as advertised has become less annoying as it has been consistently performing well. No problems since the early exchange for the dud. Maybe they just need to change their advertising angle as it isn't bad at all, but is NOT industrial grade. Because of it's consistently very high talk quality and ease of use, I have upped it a star. ____________________________ UPDATE: two months later... Returned the original phone because the screen kept going blank. Had no problems at Verizon with the exchange because it had been purchased within 30 days and have had no problems with the replacement phone. The reception is still VERY good and the Battery life long. But still... it is not a rugged phone by any stretch. There is no such thing as an industrial grade phone. Please Motorola, start making something in the USA! ----------------------------- Maybe this was designed to military specs, but it is just a cheap plastic phone... toy even. I don't know where the metal and glass is on this consumer version of what may have once been an industrial grade design. The hinge doesn't seem to be metal, it seems to be plastic although it could be aluminum or some other inexpensive and light metal. The screen doesn't seem to be glass, but plastic. screen goes completely white randomly, rendering it useless a good deal of the time. Don't know that it would survive even a 2 foot drop, since it didn't seem to make it through shipping without getting messed up. The product description is a joke compared to what was actually delivered. Looking for a rugged phone? Don't look to the Barrage unless appearances are all that matters. This phone should be heavy, it weighs nothing and feels cheap. I don't know that a truly rugged phone exists anymore. If Motorola won't make a quality product in the USA, there's no one that will. The only thing positive about this phone is that it does seem to get rather good reception when the screen isn't white. If Motorola wants to tout this phone as rugged, they need to use the original design components or change the description from metal and glass to thin plastic, made in China.

666,"I was in the market for a new phone, and I had the following list of desires: + Tetherable wireless modem. + Ruggedized + Uses the same USB interface as my wife's and son's phones I first ordered a different ruggedized VZW phone, because it was advertised with more features and was well reviewed. The problem was, the other brand of phone did not come with a USB cable, nor was one available. While I was searching around for the cable online, I tried out the extra features, such as the thermometer- it was off by 4 to 6 degrees Farenheit, making it pretty useless. The LED flashlight was nice, but not nicer than being able to surf the WEB surfside. So, I exchanged it for this much less glitzy Motorola Barrage. I have already used it to get my email and upload documents far from any available Wi-Fi hot spots (cool!) and it has come in handy when I am in the shower and I get an important phone call (like from my wife). It also uses the same cord as the other cell phones in the family, which is great on trips. It has some other surprisingly useful features. For example, I can make a call without looking at the phone because it pronounces the names of my contacts as I scroll through the list. Also, it is actually very useful to know who is calling without having to put down whatever I am carrying to look at the cell phone display. The voice recognition, e.g., ""Call... John... Mobile,"" actually work on this phone for me and that is a first. I already have several great digital cameras, so I always thought having a camera phone was sort of stupid. But the other day I bought something at the lumber store that didn't have a sticker. No problem, I just snapped a picture of the display tag, and the cashier keyed the SKU right in. I put one of those 4 GB micro SD cards into the phone for $11 so I can transfer files back and forth from the phone to my laptop, or to other computers. That's when one gewfy 'feature' of the phone showed up. When you first plug it in to the USB cable, you get to choose between ""Media Sync Mode"" and ""Modem Mode."" Choosing ""Media Sync"" gives you the option to either download music, or NOT. ""Not"" mode does nothing... nada... Zippo... except to charge the battery. If you want to transfer files or photos, you have to go into ""Tools"" and select ""USB Mass Storage."" But even *that* is gewfy, because there are two menu items that have the phrase 'USB'. To transfer files, you want the one that results from, ""MENU, Settings & Tools, 2. Tools, 8. USB Mass Storage,"" and *not* ""MENU, Settings & Tools, 9. USB Mode."" Pretty stinkin' ridiculous, eh? The bluetooth pairing thingie works, but I can't get used to making or answering calls on a headset. Plus, people who walk around in public talking to themselves seem icky to me. I might get a car adapter someday, and I am confident this phone will work with it. Other than that one weird menu glitch, I really, really like this phone.",  market new phone following list desire Tetherable wireless modem Ruggedized Uses USB interface wife son phone first order different ruggedize VZW phone advertise feature well review problem brand phone come USB cable one available search around cable online try extra feature thermometer degree Farenheit make pretty useless LED flashlight nice nicer able surf WEB surfside exchange much less glitzy Motorola Barrage already use get email upload document far available Wi Fi hot spot cool come handy shower get important phone call like wife also use cord cell phone family great trip surprisingly useful feature example make call without look phone pronounce name contact scroll list Also actually useful know call without put whatever carry look cell phone display voice recognition e g Call John Mobile actually work phone first already several great digital camera always think camera phone sort stupid day buy something lumber store sticker problem snap picture display tag cashier key SKU right put one GB micro SD card phone transfer file back forth phone laptop computer one gewfy feature phone show first plug USB cable get choose Media Sync Mode Modem Mode Choosing Media Sync give option either download music mode nothing nada Zippo except charge battery want transfer file photo go Tools select USB Mass Storage even gewfy two menu item phrase USB transfer file want one result MENU Settings Tools Tools USB Mass Storage MENU Settings Tools USB Mode Pretty stinkin ridiculous eh bluetooth pair thingie work get use make answer call headset Plus people walk around public talk seem icky might get car adapter someday confident phone work one weird menu glitch really really like phone,0.1505967005967006,Positive,0.9831,Positive,Positive
667,"My wife and I finally decided to upgrade our VZW phones but really didn't want or need ""smart"" phones. Unfortunately, most carriers have drastically reduced the number and quality of basic ""feature"" phones they carry - I suspect it's an underhanded effort to ""encourage"" customers to buy the more expensive phones and data plans. At the kiosk where we shopped - there were only 3 feature phones available and the Motorola Barrage seemed to be the pick of the litter. My Barrage has worked well since the purchase - however - I make very few calls during the day and the ones I do make are brief. On the other hand, my wife's Barrage was a disaster... she uses hers just a little more than I use mine - but is not, by any means, a cell phone junkie. Her initial charge lasted 5 days - GREAT! The next full charge lasted about 3 days - HUH? The next full charge lasted less than a day - CRAP!!! Verizon gladly offered to exchange the phone - but they were 'out of stock'. We waited several days for a replacement - only to learn that the phone was being discontinued and there would be NO new ones. A couple of these phones were finally located at a WalMart about 20 mile away - so, I made the trip and exchanged the phones. HOWEVER, her new phone was worse than the first.... the initial full charge lasted just a little over a day. I did an internet search and found this to be quite a common problem for this phone. I tried every posted ""fix"" to no avail. My wife grew tired of dealing with it and finally exchanged her Barrage for an LG Clout... which has performed flawlessly and gives her 5 days to a full charge. I'm just praying MY Barrage doesn't peter out now. Maybe I'm lucky and got a ""good"" one. Other minor complaints.... the battery cover is hard to install properly - even the Verizon agent didn't know how. If the cover is not FULLY seated, the phone WILL NOT be water resistant..... you can find this discussed on several different websites as well. Once you learn a few tricks, it becomes easier to do. The MP3 player interface is the quite dated and clunky old Verizon ""V Cast"".... it's high time Verizon reworked this dinosaur into something a little more flexible. There is no graphic equalizer - heck, there's not even a basic tone adjustment - so you'll have to live with the fairly flat audio the player has. The headphone jack is 2.5mm - unfortunately, common headphones have a 3.5mm plug and won't work without an adapter (I finally bought a pair of BlackBerry earbuds with a 2.5mm plug on Amazon for $4 and they work GREAT!!!). The Barrage is a bit thick compared to other flip phones and may be uncomfortable to hold in smaller hands. The thickness also makes finding a suitable case difficult. So - only 1 (out of 3) of these phones worked for us.... those are not great odds. I like mine so far - but I'm nervous that it won't last and I can not recommend this phone without some serious reservations. If you're seriously considering this phone (as Dirty Harry would say) you've got to ask yourself one question: ""Do I feel lucky?"" Well do ya, punk?",  wife finally decide upgrade VZW phone really want need smart phone Unfortunately carrier drastically reduce number quality basic feature phone carry suspect underhanded effort encourage customer buy expensive phone data plan kiosk shop feature phone available Motorola Barrage seem pick litter Barrage work well since purchase however make call day one make brief hand wife Barrage disaster use little use mine mean cell phone junkie initial charge last day GREAT next full charge last day HUH next full charge last less day CRAP Verizon gladly offer exchange phone stock wait several day replacement learn phone discontinue would new one couple phone finally locate WalMart mile away make trip exchange phone HOWEVER new phone bad first initial full charge last little day internet search find quite common problem phone try every post fix avail wife grow tire deal finally exchange Barrage LG Clout perform flawlessly give day full charge pray Barrage peter Maybe lucky get good one minor complaint battery cover hard install properly even Verizon agent know cover FULLY seat phone water resistant find discuss several different website well learn trick become easy MP player interface quite dated clunky old Verizon V Cast high time Verizon rework dinosaur something little flexible graphic equalizer heck even basic tone adjustment live fairly flat audio player headphone jack mm unfortunately common headphone mm plug work without adapter finally buy pair BlackBerry earbuds mm plug Amazon work GREAT Barrage bit thick compare flip phone may uncomfortable hold small hand thickness also make find suitable case difficult phone work us great odds like mine far nervous last recommend phone without serious reservation seriously consider phone Dirty Harry would say get ask one question feel lucky Well ya punk,0.027736964528009302,Positive,0.9777,Positive,Negative

After 8 months of use, this phone started making beeps when I plugged in the charger and gave spurious warning messages that it had the ""wrong battery"", ""unsupported battery"", even though it would eventually usually recharge. I called Samsung warrantee service, and they made a ticket and UPS label to send in the battery. Within two weeks after I sent it in, they finished the service and sent me an email they had shipped out a replacement. After 3 weeks it hadn't arrived, and when I checked the tracking number, I discovered they'd mailed it to some guy in Florida, not Hawaii. It took me a month of multiple phone calls and submissions on the web to get Samsung Service in Plano, Texas, to send me another battery.

I called Samsung and they told me to send in the handset without the battery or the door, which I did.

828,"I had an absolutely terrible experience with the original Rugby.. I had 3 of them that broke inside of a year (from the *original* date of purchase, mind you). B/c of the false information AT&T gave me on multiple calls (5 calls!), I could not get a new, alternative brand phone. So, I was forced into The Rugby II. Well, I'm happy to say it is much more reliable than the original! I haven't had any dropped calls. I haven't had any spontaneous connecting to the internet, either. The PTT button is still in the same spot as the original, but I don't seem to hit it as often. *shrug* I have a data plan, but this is not user friendly for that purpose. It will take pretty decent pictures when it's folded. The texting bit is still a hassle, though. Predictive texting is easier, but a bit sketchy, and I haven't found a way to get rid of words from its vocabulary once they've been added. It's bulky and heavy, too, but it helps me keep up with it. If I'm suddenly feeling lighter, I know I've left my phone somewhere. LOL If you want a feather-light phone or one with all the bells and whistles, this isn't the phone you want. You'll need a heavy duty case, too. I use a magnetic one made by body glove. I haven't had any difficulty pairing the Rugby II to my mac or my phone, or my PDA for that matter (BUT it won't SYNC with the Mac or PDA b/c they're not Windows machines). I can send pics, videos, etc. with no difficulty. Also, on the previous phones, I don't know if there was a voice dial option, but it's on the II. It's just a big P.I.T.A. to use, and it takes too long to respond. Don't try to voice dial 911. You'll die before the call's been made (maybe I'm exaggerating a little bit! lol). The memory's decent, but that was never a complaint of mine with the original, either. From a non-smartphone point of view, this phone may intimidate those who are not very tech-savvy. It took awhile for me to get used to the Rugbys after having a more ""consumer-ized"" phone. Initially I felt like Jethro Gibbs (NCIS fans).. ""how does this damn thing work?"" ""Can't you reboot it?"" LOL The front display powers off too quickly, but that is also true of the original Rugby. Now that my faith in Samsung has turned slightly for the better again, I'm getting a Samsung WEP570 bluetooth earpiece. I'll review that soon, too. Potential Rugby II users: It's not as super cool as other phones out there, but it'll 'git 'er done.' Just be prepared to be patient. It's NOT lightning fast..

After only two months, the phone would not charge. We bought a new battery and an external charger; still would not turn on. I called Samsung, but because he had a small crack in the outerscreen, the waranty was void. I was told that even though the cracked screen had nothing to do with the charging problem, the charging problem would not be covered under waranty and I would be responsilbe for all repairs, including the screen, and I wouldn't know the cost until I sent the phone to them. Instead I took the phone to a phone repair shop. They checked the phone and said the power supply was defective and it would cost more to fix than the phone is worth. It is extreemly annoying that a ""Rugged"" phone would quit after only two months and that the waranty is void because of a basically cosmetic issue with the outer screen.

831,"The Rugby II ""replaced"" my old (and very sturdy) Nokia. The ever-reliable Nokia had served me faithfully for 7 full years when ATT determined that it couldn't tolerate such superb service in its network. The planet's largest telecommunications company sent a note advising their non-support for excellence but offering a ""free"" upgrade at an ATT store. I went in. Now the story gets ugly. 1. The store employees urged against the several ""free"" phones, pointing out that they were unpopular models for which ATT was discontinuing sale. They were simply offloading what should have been landfill. 2. I asked, then, what would be a no-frills model that was as rugged as Old Nokia. They replied, ""None,"" but did recommend the misnamed Rugby as the next best thing. The catch: since I was declining a ""free"" phone, I'd need to buy the ""reliable"" model. 3. In ""upgrading"" to a worse phone, ATT charged an additional upgrade fee, cut my minutes in half, and locked in a new 2 year contract. Because I was leaving on a business trip for the Middle East the next day, I sucked it up and bought the Rugby. The story gets uglier. 1. The phone seriously overheats after about 15 minutes of use. 2. The buttons and menu are aggressively counter-intuitive. 3. The voice quality is the the worst I have ever encountered. 4.

833,"If you are looking for a somewhat old-fashioned cell phone -- i.e., no touchscreen and no querty pad -- this may be the one for you; indeed, I am okay with it in all respects except one, but it's a biggie. Thus, there is a PTT key on the left-hand side of the phone that is extremely sensitive and almost unavoidable when you open or otherwise handle the phone. As a result, I've received the PTT initialization prompt about three dozen times during my first two days of ownership. If you WANT PTT, that might not be so bad; but I want neither to use nor to pay for the feature, so this is a problem I encounter virtually every time I use the phone. I used the Samsung web site to ask how I might go about disabling the feature and received a response revealing that Samsung doesn't know how to do it. They suggested that I get in touch with my service provider, which I will do eventually, but I am stunned that Samsung doesn't have a fix for this. I would not have purchased the phone if I had known about this problem. This is my first -- and likely my last -- product from Samsung, and I don't much like their web site either.

849,I'm still fairly new with this phone so I won't speak to it's long term durability as some other reviewers have but my first impression is SAMSUNG has made a fairly decent product that's been turned into a money shake-down device by AT&T. My father who is quite inept with technology and notoriously hard on his phones chose the Rugby as it seemed to offer simplicity and durability. It seems like it is so until you start endlessly having to decline adding services. He doesn't necessarily want Push To Talk but EVERY TIME he answers the Rugby his finger rests on the PTT button and he first has to decline adding that feature before he can answer. The only way to disable it is to physically damage the button so it will not activate. The large center button is of course a browser launch shortcut which he hit's all the time. Was there not a class action about data use entrapment? There should be another. There is a GPS button which is easy for a senior to hit that also launches a service he does not want and cannot be disabled. The menu is a further fleece attempt festooned with AT&T services he doesn't want or need. Were we not stuck with AT&T due to location this would certainly have been the final straw. I'm looking forward to Apple finally getting the iPhone somewhere else so AT&T's subscriber pen get's busted open and they finally have to stop shaking down customers for accidental service in order to retain them.

I have spent more than 20 hours on the phone talking with several different Samsung technical people and they couldn't help me find any way to connect the Samsung SGH-A847 Rugby II to any type of PC. I have three computers, one an HP desktop with Windows 7 64 bit, the other an HP desktop with Windows Vista 32 bit, the third one a laptop with Windows Vista 32 bit. For hours on end I followed the detailed instructions of Samsung Support technicians and to no avail. The phone is detected by the computer (the computer makes a sound and there is for a moment a bar in the Samsung New PC Studio software), but that's it. I purchased and added a memory card to use the 'mass storage' function, hoping this will give me some kind of connectivity, but it didn't work either. Furthermore, and this is very unfortunate to the users, the Samsung ""New PC Studio"" software has not been licensed and approved by Microsoft and the software is labeled by all Windows computers as a dangerous program that will harm your computer when you are in the process of installing it. Of course this is not true, (Norton Antivirus says the program is safe) but right now the problem is that Windows computers are labeling the Samsung software as dangerous and harmful when it is not and probably affecting its functionality. The Samsung ""New PC Studio"" is the software that is supposed to let you communicate your phone with your computer. The program loads and works but will not 'sync' with the Samsung SGH-A847 phone or connect to it, no matter how hard you try or how many tricks you pursue. Every time you get the message that there are no devices connected. In today's world, an 'advanced' cellular phone that is not recognized by any computer and will not 'sync' or connect with the computer no matter what you try or do, is simply not acceptable.

861,"So within a few months of owning the phone, it began to turn itself off CONSTANTLY. It didn't seem random...rather, it seemed to happen when the phone rang and I attempted to pick it up. Other times it would just shut off in my pocket. I became obsessed with checking the phone to ensure it was still on since I used the phone for my job, and like most working folks, my phone calls are super important. Honestly, this obsession started to ruin my life and I'm not even exagerating. I removed the memory card because I thought that might have something to do with it...nope. I cleaned the terminals making contact with the battery...nope. I reset the phone, thereby erasing all of my data and contact information...nope. I didn't swap out the battery because the phone wasn't that old. Eventually, one day, whilst hanging a ceiling fan in my house, the phone rang, which was remarkable given the aforementioned. This was a particularly tense moment of the installation - the moment when you've just finished mating the wires and are holding the motor in place while you screw it in to the ceiling-mounted anchor. As my thumb wedged between the keypad and the screen to flip it open, it turned off. I lost it. I threw the phone into the wall and it shattered into pieces. The phone is no longer a problem now.

865,"I've had this phone for over a year now and have to say, it's done quite well for me. It's not too technical with the features and has a front screen on the outside. Why I picked this out was because it's a flip phone. . . those who have had open faced phones know how they tend to dial unexpectedly! The phone's camera does quite well (standard quality though), although most do nowadays. One of my favorite features about this phone is the customization with the menu. It allows you to customize the shortcuts and also you get to pick out your four top menu options (ex. text, pics, video etc. . . you choose) My last camera was a motorolla razr and found that this is a much tougher phone with the look and feel. It's not the fanciest but it will do all you need for your phone needs (and you're not required to sign up on a service contract for internet etc.) The only features I would say this phone lags in is the speaker. It's not too bad but it can be somewhat blurry on phone conversations, almost like you are hearing someone talk through a pillow (but does not occur too frequently, not really an issue). The other is that there are some buttons somewhere that get pushed while the phone is in my pocket, the camera takes pictures and when you go through your picture folder you see a whole load of black pictures (from being in your pocket). But it is a great phone overall, it is solid enough for me, has a decent features and does very well for a phone that isn't a 'smart phone'.",  phone year say do quite well technical feature front screen outside pick flip phone open face phone know tend dial unexpectedly phone camera quite well standard quality though although nowadays One favorite feature phone customization menu allow customize shortcut also get pick four top menu option ex text pic video etc choose last camera motorolla razr find much tough phone look feel fancy need phone need require sign service contract internet etc feature would say phone lag speaker bad somewhat blurry phone conversation almost like hear someone talk pillow occur frequently really issue button somewhere get push phone pocket camera take picture go picture folder see whole load black picture pocket great phone overall solid enough decent feature well phone smart phone,0.07502088554720135,Positive,0.9285,Positive,Positive
866,". . . my second Samsung Rugby II phone has been returned to the point of purchase. I had the first one for two days before the battery quit holding a charge for longer than a few hours. I would charge it all night, but by the next afternoon, the battery was running out of power. Now, this problem occurred even if I did not actually use the phone, and no applications were left running either. So I swapped that phone for a second one, and it lasted about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. I phoned ATT customer service each time to document the problem and asked if there were any issues being tracked for these phones. The polite staff there told me that there were no issues, so I asked that my report be logged, and I asked for a replacement battery. ATT shipped the new replacement battery, and this one worked great. . . for about 8 days before the same battery problem recurred. So the phone ended up being plugged into its charger for many hours each day and night, but, when this phone is charging, you cannot receive incoming calls. Why Samsung did not consider that drawback a huge problem is puzzling, confounding, and unforgivable. Combine that issue with the irritating ""push to talk"" button which is nearly impossible to avoid, and the net result is a high frustration factor. I can understand now why these phone are supposedly rugged and shockproof. The urge to hurl the Rugby II against the closest hard surface can be hard to check. I managed to ditch this clunker just before my 30-day trial period ended. Let me say, it has been a trial, too.

867,"After using the new Samsung Rugby II cell phone from AT&T for almost a year now, I am still struggling and still just as frustrated with it as I was when I first starting to use it. Although the physical features of the phone are very nice, there are too many technical inconveniences about the phone from the text messaging to the general usage of the phone that have caused me to literally hate it. When Alltel made the switch to AT&T after being bought out, I was forced to choose a new phone from a list of phones comparable to the current phone I had at the time. I really liked the current phone I had because it was simple and easy to use so I knew what to look for in a new phone, provided it had a rugged body, and a few new perks. After reviewing each of the phones and their features, there was only one phone that filled that description. I chose the Samsung Rugby II after reviewing all of its features and descriptions displayed on the AT&T website. I was not familiar with AT&T phones or the particular type of phone at the time, so I had to go out on a whim to assume it was as good as it sounded. The website explained all of the physical features that made the phone unique as well as a few technological features. The physical features the website displayed were the ruggedized body which could withstand shock, humidity, high temperatures, resist dirt, and repel rain. Some of the technological features displayed were Push-to-Talk (PTT) capability, which is like a walkie-talkie in your phone, and built in GPS. The physical features of the phone are true to what the website states. The body of the phone is heavy and thick; a rugged body that has stood up to a few crashes to the ground without problems. The battery cover has a twist lock on it that seals it tight to the phone to prevent water or humidity from seeping in, and good seals along the outside to resist dirt and rain. The physical features are all a plus, especially to someone who works construction or such job that a phone would benefit from those features. My problems came with the technology of the phone. My first problem was more with the company in the fact that the built in GPS and PTT capabilities were not included with the plan and would cost an extra $9.99/ month for each, putting almost twenty extra dollars on my bill each month. The website did not state that those features were add-ons or that they would cost extra. Not to mention, there are two buttons on the phone specifically for GPS and PTT features and if I hit one of them on accident, I could get charged. There are very little customizing features that allow me to change what buttons do what which makes it difficult to avoid pushing buttons that will take me to the internet and charge me. My second problem(s) were with calls and call waiting, receiving text and voicemails, and the phone turning off at random times. If the phone goes out of the service area, I have to turn the phone off and back on to make a phone call once back in the service area. If I receive a call waiting, the phone will not automatically switch back to original call once the call waiting has hung up; I have to manually do it, which has caused me to hang up on people by pushing the button too much. If receive a text message or voicemail while out of service, I will sometimes not receive them for as many as three days later for some unknown reason. At times, when I am on the phone connected to my Bluetooth, my phone will re-start itself while I am on the phone with someone, causing the call to be disconnected. One minor issue that caused a big problem was with the alarm. If the phone is on vibrate or silent, the alarm is too, so if I didn't want to be disturbed in the middle of the night by drunk-dialers or prank calls, I'd better had a back-up plan. I found that out when I received a phone call from work wondering if I was coming in or not as I was already an hour late. Most phones will turn themselves on if an alarm is set to go off and the phone is off. But my most hated part of this phone has to be the text messaging. With a new phone I expected the text messaging to be even better then it was when the T9 option came out. T9 is suppose to be faster because it is suppose to predict the text you are going to write. That is not the case; in fact, on this phone it is even worse than ever. This phone has to have more steps then the world trade center to write and send a text. It does not recognize frequently used words or phrases so I am constantly pushing more buttons to switch to the word I want then if I was just to do it manually. It does not show predictions for the word I am going to type and I have to delete an entire word just to change one letter. I also have to go through about six steps just to send the message. Basically, texting for me is slower then to just call the person I want to talk to. There is no reason for me to keep this phone and the physical features are not worth the frustration this phone has caused me. I consider myself to be pretty good at figuring new technologies out once I have had enough time to play around with them but, in this case I have had this phone for almost a year do not feel as though I should still be confused by it. In this day of technology, I would think we would be past this point. This phone seems to have been a step down from that and I hope AT&T will recognize that.",  use new Samsung Rugby II cell phone almost year still struggle still frustrate first start use Although physical feature phone nice many technical inconvenience phone text messaging general usage phone cause literally hate Alltel make switch buy force choose new phone list phone comparable current phone time really like current phone simple easy use know look new phone provide rugged body new perk review phone feature one phone fill description choose Samsung Rugby II review feature description display website familiar phone particular type phone time go whim assume good sound website explain physical feature make phone unique well technological feature physical feature website displayed ruggedize body could withstand shock humidity high temperature resist dirt repel rain technological feature display Push Talk PTT capability like walkie talkie phone build GPS physical feature phone true website state body phone heavy thick rugged body stand crash ground without problem battery cover twist lock seal tight phone prevent water humidity seep good seal along outside resist dirt rain physical feature plus especially someone work construction job phone would benefit feature problem come technology phone first problem company fact build GPS PTT capability include plan would cost extra month put almost twenty extra dollar bill month website state feature add ons would cost extra mention two button phone specifically GPS PTT feature hit one accident could get charge little customizing feature allow change button make difficult avoid push button take internet charge second problem call call wait receive text voicemail phone turn random time phone go service area turn phone back make phone call back service area receive call wait phone automatically switch back original call call waiting hang manually cause hang people push button much receive text message voicemail service sometimes receive many three day later unknown reason time phone connect Bluetooth phone start phone someone cause call disconnect One minor issue cause big problem alarm phone vibrate silent alarm want disturb middle night drunk dialers prank call well back plan find receive phone call work wonder come already hour late phone turn alarm set go phone hated part phone text messaging new phone expect text messaging even well option come suppose faster suppose predict text go write case fact phone even bad ever phone step world trade center write send text recognize frequently use word phrase constantly push button switch word want manually show prediction word go type delete entire word change one letter also go six step send message Basically texting slow call person want talk reason keep phone physical feature worth frustration phone cause consider pretty good figure new technology enough time play around case phone almost year feel though still confuse day technology would think would past point phone seem step hope recognize,0.04066352661423085,Positive,-0.9387,Negative,Positive

894,"My old Motorola 120e bar phone was wearing out (literally) after 8 years...I couldn't even see the numbers on the buttons any more. Oh, it still functioned as a phone just fine, but I had to keep a standby battery charged up to swap out, the radio feature never seemed to work well with their idiotic connection system, and most importantly my friends were posting photos on Facebook that they took with their cel telephones, without having to lug around a camera, and I wanted to get in on that. So, after looking at several phones at the Verizon store, I decided on the Samsung Gusto. What a mistake. For one, the tech at the store was unable to simply copy my old phone book from the old phone to the new one. I had to manually enter every single name and number from my list. Hundreds of contacts. For another, the camera ""feature"" in this phone is useless. Oh, it snaps the pictures just fine, and there are even a reasonable number of creative options available for the adequate 640x480 images. The problem is they are impossible to download off of the camera to view, edit or post. You can supposedly send them from the phone to a website to view them. But after spending over an hour setting up the account and website, I found that it just doesn't work. The obvious method, which would be to connect the phone to the USB port on your computer-won't work either. Evidently this is because this goofy knick-knack has some sort of cheesy proprietary software that is INCOMPATIBLE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE, which also explains why the phone book was untransferable. The salesman at the Verizon store didn't even know this, and Samsung doesn't point this out, either. You can look at the pictures on the phone's screen. That's it.

915,I bought this refurbished cell phone directly from Net10 online as part of a package deal. It was basically free with the purchase of a 30 day/750 minute phone card. I also got the universal accessories kit free. I have used this phone for a month. Last week I dropped it on a hard floor. After putting the battery and cover back on it the phone has shown no damage or problems. It appears to be durable and still works very well. Three things make an impression on me. 1) This phone is small. Not clunky. 2) Signal reception is great. No dropped calls yet! 3) The quality. I expected that a free phone in this price range would be loose or cheaply built. This phone is much better than that. The other surprise was the universal accessory kit which usually goes for around $15. It came free with a promotion code that I used during the purchase. The phone pouch is durable and the attachments are quality items. Everything works including the car charger. If you read the fine print on the Net10 website they normally send the phones with a battery and a home/wall charger. Net10 service is dependable and the phone cards can cost as little as 3 cents/minute up to the 10 cents/minute standard cards available in stores. I did call Net10 customer support to verify my order and out of curiosity about their service. What I found was that the initial response wasn't very good but I was passed off to another service tech who answered my questions quickly. This may be an instance where it depends on the particular tech that answers your call. But I did get an efficient human response to my call. Reloading minutes is easy and hassle-free also.
