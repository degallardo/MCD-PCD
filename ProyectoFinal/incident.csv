Contacted Steve Watson from ATOS space management team to fix the B037 space issue with this Mainframe SAS job: WLWIPW20.

Steve's resolution comments:
After further review I determined the job was abending with a B37 space abend on the WORK file specified in SYS2.PROCLIB.SYSA(SAS).
The original allocation for this file was (1000,75). The size of the data being placed in the WORK file caused it to span multiple DASD volumes.
The SMS DATACLAS for TEMP datasets allows them to span a maximum of 6 volumes. The size of the WORK file allocations caused it the dataset to hist 16 extents on six volumes and the job failed because it could not span to a seventh DASD volume.

After further review I determined the job was abending with a B37 space abend on the WORK file specified in SYS2.PROCLIB.SYSA(SAS).
The original allocation for this file was (1000,75). The size of the data being placed in the WORK file caused it to span multiple DASD volumes.
The SMS DATACLAS for TEMP datasets allows them to span a maximum of 6 volumes. The size of the WORK file allocations caused it the dataset to hist 16 extents on six volumes and the job failed because it could not span to a seventh DASD volume.","Solved (Permanently)","EventID: 20220514-1652575061-3970942-SYSA

             FTP service was not available due an accident on 5/31/22

Notes from Abel Aguilar Salazar from the infrastructure team: 
 Regarding this issue related to Brossard, today a car smashed in the fiber distribution plant took all the WAN connectivity out, the Local TP opened a Sev 1 Ticket today for this issue to connectivity team, we will keep you posted if something else is informed to our team
 
No sure what is the status of that issue as long as this is managed by connectivity team and at this moment from Infra SE Team, no action are needed until network is restored – thank you!
-------
As a result of this incident we backed up the file to be transferred to the server to be sent to the server when the issue get resolved.   

The issue was resolved when the server was back up on 6/1/22.  The next job run of MLMCSL26  was clean at 1:08 AM and the file was FTP 'ed successfully to the server.","Solved (Permanently)","**SWIVEL TICKET**
